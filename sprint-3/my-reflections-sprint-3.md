# My Reflections - Sprint Three 

## EQ / IQ - Emotional Intelligence

**_What was it like for you to practice mindfulness?_**

It was great! I already have the Headspace app and have been practicing meditation on and off for about a year now. It is something that I am very much in favour of, though I could definitely get into a better habit with practicing. 

**_Have you done mindfulness or attention training before?_**

You know it! As stated above, I've been practicing for awhile (though not as often as I would like!).

**_Are you able to identify any bias you have for or against mindfulness?_**

When I am in a state of anxiety, praciting mindfulness is THE LAST thing that I want to do. Instead, I would rather stew in my anxiety and fret and be silly refuse to do anything that might help. I know that's not really bias as such, but that's my own personal experience with it.

**_What did you notice as you were meditating?_**

If I counted each breath (up as far as ten before startgin again), time passed considerably quickly. However, I was quite aware of my flatmates around the house and found it to be quite distracting.

**_How did you find the overall experience?_**

Grand! It always makes me feel better afterwards, even though I may not always notice.

**_What's your daily habit commitment?_**

Ten minutes everyday after getting up in the morning (whether that comes before getting ready for the day or afterwards, I will have to wait and see what works best for me).

## Listening and Looping

**_What was it like to be fully listened to?_**

It was strange having a conversation without interjections or interuptions. The usual flow of conversation is filled with them, and this one...wasn't. I struggled to fill the two minute timeslot and eventually just felt as though I was complaining for the purpose of completing the lesson. In saying that, it was nice to have someone recall what I'd said and to know that they'd actually listened. It's something that isn't practiced enough in this day and age. 

**_What was it like to fully listen?_**

GOOD! I was worried that I'd not remember what had been said, but by listening without interupting, I was able to recall everything easily. The biggest thing is not the listening itself but the recalling, and making that person to whom you are listening feel _heard_. I liked articulating their experience using my own words and allowing them to witness their own experience through my eyes. 

## In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions in your reflection:

**_How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?_**



**_Which parts of the this sprint made you feel cool?_**



**_Which parts of this sprint made you angry?_**



**_How many times during this sprint did you want to give up? Why didn't you? Do you still think you might give up?_**



**_Do you still want to be a programmer? Why?_**
