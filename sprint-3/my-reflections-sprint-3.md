#My Reflections - Sprint Three

In addition to the challenge specific refletions, answer the following questions (in addition to the challenge-specific questions) in your reflection:

Did you notice anything about your learning style? What?
It was helpful to watch a video at the same time look at articles about JavaScript. However, JavaScript itself is quite new lanaguge to me, so I am still taking time to get use to it.

When I follow the video step by step, it seems I understood. Once I stop and do it again I feel still new concept. I need to paractice again and  again.

Did you keep within the timebox suggestions? If not, how come?
It took more time for me. 

What did I notice about my learning style, strengths and limitations when researching?
Learning Java Script is like learning a new language to me. I tried to follow the video and parcticing at the same time but it still takes  a lot time. 

Did any blocks come up for you? How did you overcome them?
My steps of learning were to understand the concept of Javascript and follow the video and practice it step by step. It can be tedious and overwhelming  on and off. I tried to have a break from coding and get refeshed by exercising or having a cup of coffee.
