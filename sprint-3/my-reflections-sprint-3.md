# My Reflections - Sprint Three 

## EQ / IQ - Emotional Intelligence

**_What was it like for you to practice mindfulness?_**

It was great! I already have the Headspace app and have been practicing meditation on and off for about a year now. It is something that I am very much in favour of, though I could definitely get into a better habit with practicing. 

**_Have you done mindfulness or attention training before?_**

You know it! As stated above, I've been practicing for awhile (though not as often as I would like!).

**_Are you able to identify any bias you have for or against mindfulness?_**

When I am in a state of anxiety, praciting mindfulness is THE LAST thing that I want to do. Instead, I would rather stew in my anxiety and fret and be silly refuse to do anything that might help. I know that's not really bias as such, but that's my own personal experience with it.

**_What did you notice as you were meditating?_**

If I counted each breath (up as far as ten before startgin again), time passed considerably quickly. However, I was quite aware of my flatmates around the house and found it to be quite distracting.

**_How did you find the overall experience?_**

Grand! It always makes me feel better afterwards, even though I may not always notice.

**_What's your daily habit commitment?_**

Ten minutes everyday after getting up in the morning (whether that comes before getting ready for the day or afterwards, I will have to wait and see what works best for me).

## In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions in your reflection:

**_How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?_**



**_Which parts of the this sprint made you feel cool?_**



**_Which parts of this sprint made you angry?_**



**_How many times during this sprint did you want to give up? Why didn't you? Do you still think you might give up?_**



**_Do you still want to be a programmer? Why?_**
