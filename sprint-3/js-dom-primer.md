# The DOM Primer and DevTools Primer

### Learning Competencies 
By the end of this primer, you should be familiar with and able to :

- Explain what the DOM is and how it relates to CSS and HTML


## Summary
The Document Object Model, normally abbreviated to DOM, is the way through which JavaScript interacts with content within a website. One of the ways in which we access the DOM is using Developer Tools (DevTools). DevTools also assists us with testing and debugging websites and applications. 

In this primer, you'll be asked to research and reflect on the DOM. Don't worry too much about DevTools, you'll dive into that in the next part of this sprints material through a devtools crash course. 

## Timebox 

Challenge | Time|
------------|----------|
Research | 1 hours
Reflect | 20 minutes

## The DOM 
HTML and CSS are two of the fundamental languages found almost everywhere on the web. The Document Object Model provides the means to interact with objects in an HTML document. 

## Research 
Have a good look around the internet to undrstand what the DOM is. 
Kirupa's [videos, pictures and articles](https://www.kirupa.com/html5/javascript_the_browser_and_the_dom.htm) are a good place to begin. Rememember to keep to the timebox suggestions and learning competencies. 

Keep notes as you'll describe the DOM in your technical blog this sprint. 

## Reflect 
In your [my-reflections-sprint-3](my-reflections-sprint-3.md) answer the following questions: 

1. What did I notice about my learning style, strenghts and limitations when researching?
2. Did any blocks come up for you? How did you overcome them?
