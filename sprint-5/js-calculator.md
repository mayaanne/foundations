# Calculator

>This is what calculator is

>You will need to bring together html/css/js

>Break it down, plan it out, use this for reference

>Do it preferably in pairs, but can be done individually

>Make it in your blog

>Publish via GitHub Pages

>Have fun :+1:

## Build it

Work on the Free Code Camp 'Build a calculator' project, ideally with another member of your targeted bootcamp cohort. Keep it simple, it's well within your capabilities. And don't look at the sample solution yet.

With your pair if possible:

If you have one, check-in with your pair:
- How did you sleep?
- How do you feel now?
- Is there anything going on in your life that might affect how you are working right now?
 
Create a new git repository called "js-calculator".

Reverse pseudocode the sample solution in a waffle comment below. Remember, there is no 'right way' - the sample solution is just one implementation.

Build the app:

- Start with building the html, think about what buttons are needed on a calculator
- Next, give your calculator some style. Use skeleton, raw CSS or whatever you feel like to make your buttons look more like a real calculator.
- Finally, start working through the Javascript, this is the hardest part, so...

Take your time and work through small problems.

Make small commits

Refer to your pseudocode.

Use the Developer Tools in your browser.

Reference previous projects/materials for app structure

(If pairing, Change driver-navigator roles approx. every 30 mins)

Ask for help. You can do this!
 
If you did this challenge as a pair, spend 10 minutes asking each other these questions:

Make sure your feedback is ASK (actionable, specific, kind)
- What did you find awesome about our pairing session?
- What could have been more awesome?

This question and answer may feel difficult, but is a very valuable learning tool. It can be kind to gently help someone identify their weaknesses so that they can work on them. Remember too that your pair may not completely understand the concept in question, so take their feedback with a grain of salt.
- Did you notice any gaps in my understanding?

## Writing short functions

Take a look at your code from the calculator. Unless you've written perfect code, chances are some of it isn't as well-structured and DRY as it could be.

Your task now, either with your pair or working alone, is to refactor your code with a view to writing smaller functions that only have one job each. To help, consult the Writing short functions resource.


- Beginning with your original calculator code repository, check out a new branch called 'refactor'.

- Work through all of the code, making small changes, saving and testing them frequently as you go along.

Working slowly and methodically is the key to staying calm during this process. Don't be tempted to change too much at once, only to find the code breaks and you're not sure why!

- Each time you encounter part of your code that is longer or more complex than you'd like, move some of the code into another function.

As a very rough rule of thumb, if the function is longer than about ten lines it may need refactoring. Err on the side of creating a new function even if it seems unnecessary or pedantic, just to get the practice.

- Each time you create a new function, and have tested it to ensure that your code still works, create a new Git commit.

- When you're done, push the new branch to GitHub and add a link to it in the waffle comments below.
