# Sprint Five

For this sprint you'll find there are less primers leading you in to the challenges. That's because you have already learnt about most of the skills you need to start. This sprint is all about using those skills and practicing making larger projects with code.

Our two challenges are minesweeper and the calculator. Try your best to complete them, but if you cannot make your way through the whole challenge, a partial project can still show off all those skills that you've learnt so far.
