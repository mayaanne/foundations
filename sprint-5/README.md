# Sprint Five

For this sprint you'll find there are less primers leading you in to the challenges. That's because this sprint is all about using the skills you have learnt and practiced using so far to code our two main challenges, minesweeper and the calculator. Try your best to complete them, but if  them a partial answer will still show off what you've learnt so far.
