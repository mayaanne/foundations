# Pair Programming

>Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work as a pair together on one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the navigator, focuses on the bigger picture, and immediately spots mistakes.

>Together, the programmers help each other hold strong attention on the task. It is a simple but very effective tool.

>## When pairing

- First, check-in with your pair
- Assign roles (driver vs navigator)
- Explain your thinking in a clear concise manner
- Keep a timer, to monitor how long you have been in a certain role
