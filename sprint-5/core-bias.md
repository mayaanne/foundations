### Learning Competencies
By the end of this exploration, you should be able to:

- Describe the difference between bias and stereotypes and how this may affect our ability to work well with others
- Utilise tools to address bias in ourselves.

## Summary
_Bias_ is as term used to describe a tendency or preference towards a particular perspective, ideology or result, especially when the tendency interferes with ones ability to be impartial, unprejudiced, or objective.  

A _Stereotype_ is a preconceived idea that attributes certain characteristics to all the members of class or set.  The term is often used when refering to an oversimplified, exaggerated or demeaning assumption.

In this exploration we aim to broaden your awareness of stereotypes, your own bias towards yourself and or others and how having a better understanding of both will lift your ability to work well with others.

## Am I biased?
As a human species, bias is hardwired to our DNA.  We are naturally drawn to what is familiar and safe, yet we now live in a diverse society with a variety of different peoples, cultures and values - we are often not aware of the  bias we hold and how these bias can impact our own ability to connect and or work with others.

To better understand what stereotypes we acknowledge or what biases we hold - let's first engage with an activity.

Grab either a pen and paper or open a blank document on your laptop looking at the references to groups or catergories of people below. 
Write the first few words that come to mind, don't think about it, just write:

- Librarians are…
- Australians are…
- Old people are…
- Accountants are…
- Rugby players are…
- Hairdressers are…
- Millenials are...
