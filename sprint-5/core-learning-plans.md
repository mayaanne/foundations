# Learning Plans - Preparing for Bootcamp     

### Learning Competencies
By the end of this challenge, you should:

- Have a clear understanding of how to apply and adapt your Learning Plan in Bootcamp
- Have clear expectations of what to expect once Bootcamp begins to ensure you can continue to build on your self directed learning journey.

## Summary
Your learning plan describes how you will operate within the context of the Dev Academy Foundations and Bootcamp Program. It has been a tool used between you and your facilitator as a Kaupapa for your individual learning. 

The goal for us in Foundations has always been to ensure we have prepared you as best as we possibly can for Bootcamp.  By now, you are used to the flow and structure of Foundations and things will change in Bootcamp.

To ensure you are set up to continue evolving your Learning Plan, in this challenge we will be working together to prepare you and your Learning Plan for the next part of your Dev Academy journey - Bootcamp.

## Complete Form
Please take 30 minutes to complete the [Learning Plan - Preparation for Bootcamp Student Form](https://goo.gl/forms/HyNR2OCvbjhD1nOE3).

This form has been created for you (the student) to complete as a part of your Sprint 5 Core Learning in Foundations.  The answers you provide here will inform your final one on one (1:1) with your Foundations facilitator and assist with preparing you and your learning plan for Bootcamp.

Check that you have a session booked in with you facilitator for your final week of Foundations and please make sure you have completed this form before then.

## Setting your expectations for Bootcamp
It can feel quite disruptive moving from one phase of a course to another.  In this case, you are moving from Foundations to commence your 9 week intensive web development Bootcamp. There are differences in how things are run in Bootcamp, compared to what you are used to in Foundations so let's look at what you can expect once you hit Bootcamp:

- __Weekly check-in's with your Human Skills (Core) facilitators.__

Each week of Bootcamp you will have 1:1 time with your Human Skills (Core) facilitators.  This isn't a time to address technical queries, it is the time for us to support you and your emotional well being throughout Bootcamp.

In Auckland, your Human Skills facilitator is Dougal Stott. In Wellington, your Human Skills facilitator is Ming Jansen.  We also have our Human Skills Lead Sarrah Jayne who assists across campuses and is based in Wellington. You will have to chance to meet them Day 1 of Bootcamp.

- __End of Phase Tech-in's with your Teacher/s.__

In Bootcamp you will be complete three, 3 week phases.  Weeks 1 - 3 is Phase One, Weeks 4 - 6 is Phase Two, and Weeks 7 - 9 is Phase Three - The Final Phase.

At the end of each Phase you will have a Tech-in with your teacher/s.  This will be 1:1 time where your teachers will be able to provide you with feedback on your technical progress and address any technical concerns you may have.

## Keep evolving your Learning Plans throughout Bootcamp

Now that you know when planned 1:1 times are throughout Bootcamp you can begin to build habits in your week to evolve your Learning Plans. Keep things simple.  

Here are some suggestions you can apply yourself:
- __Book in 20 minutes at the start or end of each week for you to reflect on your learning plan and your learning journey in Bootcamp. Update your learning plan with the relevant information or remove any information that is no longer relevant.__

Have you noticed your strengths in practice?  
Had any setbacks or challenges that week? What did you do to overcome these?
What will you differently next time?  
What was a highlight for you?  

- __Take your Learning Plans with you to your Weekly check-in's or End of Phase Tech-in's with your teacher/s.__
Use this 1:1 time to reflect on your Learning Plan.


Your success in Bootcamp depends a lot on your motivation and organisation as learner.  It also relies on your ability to bring your whole self and work alongside others kanohi ki te kanohi (face to face).

This change in your learning environment will bring it's own benefits and challenges - it is a great opportunity for you to learn and grow with deliberate intention and your Learning Plan will be a tool to help you achieve this.
