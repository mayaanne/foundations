# My Learning Agreement

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this exercise, you should

- Formulated your Learning Agreement
- Published your Learning Agreement as a personal blog

### Summary

This programme is not a traditional programme. It depends a lot on your motivation and organisation as a learner. This leads to a more individualised experience and increased learning skills moving forward. To facilitate this everyone will have a Learning Agreement. This learning agreement will be negotiated between you and a facilitator. It will include setting your learning targets based on the course learning outcomes, what you expect to do to meet your targets, and what the facilitator is expected to do. This agreement is a core part of your learning and will develop your skills to set and achieve target in the future. We fully expect this agreement to develop as you become more aware of how you work and learn.

## Exploration and Application

Exploration | Time to box |
------------|----------|
Attend learning plan workshop | 1 hour
Formulate learning Agreement | 1 hour 
Confirm learning plan with facilitor | 30 minutes
 
### Description 

The learning agreement describes how you will operate within the context of the Dev Academy Foundations and Bootcamp Program. It will be negotiated with peers and facilitators as a Kaupapa for your individual learning. You'll use last weeks exploration of values, identity and strengths to describe the motivations are and the values you are bringing into your learning experience. 

## Participation
Your success in this programme depends on your full commitment to doing what you say you will do. The bottom line is that if you say what, how and when you will do something, everyone working with you will expect it delivered as promised. Anything different should be negotiated in a timely and professional manner to alter those expectations.

There are three aspects of participation that should think about specifically addressed in that agreement:
• it is difficult to develop a supportive community of learners if you are not fully taking part in that community
• our whole Ako approach to learning from each other as equals, is hard to do if we are not all there. Staff then have to take on the role of trying to “chase” learners to participate
• our resources are unnecessarily stretched and not focussed on productive work if staff are sitting waiting for a 1:1 and no one shows up, we could have been working on course development that would help everyone.
• What will you do when things are building up and starting to get to you.


## Formulate Learning Agreement
The Learning Agreement needs to include the following elements:  		 
	 	 
- A description of your own strengths and limitations 
- Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.
- A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
- A description of what you expect from the facilitation team
- Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.
- For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.
- These elements do not need to be structured as they are in this list. You should put them together in the way that you 0 feel they are most clearly communicated.

Once you have formulated your plan, you'll need to have your facilitator agree to it.
