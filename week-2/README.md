# Week Two

__A prerequisite course for Dev Academy Bootcamp__

This week is a big week - you'll need 40-45 hours to complete it. In the first half you'll whizz around HTML and CSS basics (approx 20-25 hours) and in the part you'll dive into solving JavaScript challenges. To help with this workload, we recommend: 

- Keep to the timebox suggestions 
- Attempt to solve each challenge within 5 minutes. Any longer, seek support online (cohort, forums, google). Take a break and come back to it.
