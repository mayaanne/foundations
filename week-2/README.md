# Week Two

__A prerequisite course for Dev Academy Bootcamp__

In the first part this week you'll dive into HTML and CSS, the language of the web, and create a blog using HTML and CSS that you'll contribute to through out your journey. Secondly you'll use last weeks core material and reflections to  pull together your learning plan. You'll need to arrange a time to pair with an EDA facilitator to establish to negotiate that plan.
