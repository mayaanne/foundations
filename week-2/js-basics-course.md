By the end of this course, you should be familiar with:

- Variables and Object types 
- Datatypes

## Summary
JavaScript is known as the "language of the web." It is a powerful object-oriented language that is light-weight and can communicate with the browser. You'll dive straight into the deep end and complete FreeCodeCamp's JavaScript Basics course. To compliment FreeCodeCamps' practice centric interface, we recommend exploring either Kirupa's or Udacity's visual and audial materials . 



## Exploration and Challenge

Challenge | Time to box |
------------|----------|
Udacity or Kirupa | 1 hour
FreeCodeCamp | 10 hours
Reflect | 1 hour

## Preparing for surprises
Just like everything on the web, FreeCodeCamp has it's bugs. There could be times where your solution is perfect, but FreeCodeCamp is throwing an error. Be sure to query it, and descern where the issue is stemming from. If its FreeCodeCamp, you'll read about it in the forums. Try using the exact name of the challenge in google. Remember, one of your tasks as budding web developer, is to query errors and find its source!


## Warm up 
Spend an hour getting a sense of JavaScript using either of these resources. Don't worry about taking in the details, use the tutorials to give you a brief overview. You'll jump into practice in the FreeCodeCamp step. 

_Pro-tip: Speed up the video's as you watch them._

- [Kirupa's Basic JavaScript]((https://www.kirupa.com/javascript_basics/index.htm)  


## FreeCodeCamp 
There are a lot of challenges to complete in FreeCodeCamp. Be pragamatic and keep pushing through. If you get stuck, take a break and come back to it.  


1. Sign-up or sign-in using your GitHub acccount. 
2. Complete the [FreeCodeCamp Basic-JavaScript course](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript)
