## Summary
We've selected a couple of choices for learning HTML and CSS. You'll need to create an account with FreeCodeCamp and or Udacity and give each a go. 

Udacity is media rich, with some files to practice.
FreeCodeCamp is practice rich and requires you to apply a little more problem solving. 

Try both of them and work out which suits you. Always keep in mind the learning objectives. Ask yourself for example, "Can I navigate the DOM?". The courses should cover all the basics, but if you're still wondering "what is the DOM" then put your powers to good use and discover it. Frame the question well, reach out and have a discussion with someone in your cohort. Bring it up during a check in.

[4 minute summary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT0Lh1eYk78) of what HTML, CSS and JavaScript are 

## FreeCodeCamp + YouTube

FreeCodeCamp's interface can be a little unfriendly, but its methodology is solid. 
If you'd like to add some complimentary media to prime your mind, we recommend LearnCode.academy on Youtube.

Navigate to your `my-reflections-week-2` file (Pro-tip: Use terminal) 

Answer: 

- What resources you used and why 
- Obsticals you came up against and how you over came them
- What questions did you ask, and how was the process of solving them? 
- Did you keep within the timebox suggestions? If not, how come?
- What are of you proud of 
- What would you do better if you did it all over again?
