# Learning to Learn HTML and CSS Challenge 

### Learning Competencies Part 1
By the end of the first part, you should:
* Selected a path to learn from and gain an understanding in: 
  * Basic HTML page with the appropriate tags (html, head, title,etc.)
  * How to add paragraphs, headings, links, images, lists, and/or tables  
  * How to divide content on a page using divs and spans

### Learning Competencies Part 2
By the end of the second part, you should be able to:

* Understand and apply classes, id's  
* Navigate the DOM 
* Understand and use box design 
* Understand and create responsive design 
* Understand and use semantic structuring 


## Summary
We've selected a couple of choices for learning HTML and CSS. You'll need to create an account with FreeCodeCamp and or Udacity and give each a go. 

Udacity is media rich, with some files to practice.
FreeCodeCamp is practice rich and requires you to apply a little more problem solving. 

Try both of them and work out which suits you. Always keep in mind the learning objectives. Ask yourself for example, "Can I navigate the DOM?". The courses should cover all the basics, but if you're still wondering "what is the DOM" then put your powers to good use and discover it. Frame the question well, reach out and have a discussion with someone in your cohort. Bring it up during a check in.

## Preparing for surprises
Just like everything on the web, FreeCodeCamp and Udacity have their bugs. It can take some patience to discern if the error is a bug or if its caused by your code. One of your tasks as budding web developer, is to query errors and recognise where the error is comming from.

Ask yourself - does it work in a different browser? Have other's encoutered this error? Check the [unblock resource](../resources/getting-unblocked.md) 


## FreeCodeCamp + YouTube

FreeCodeCamp's interface can appear a little unfriendly to the untrained eye, but its methodology is solid. You'll be using the "Responsive web Design track". Pair it with demonstrations from YouTube to enhance your learning.

 ## Online research 
 Start identifying what it is that you need to know in order to reach the learning Competencies. Where are your knowledge gaps? Compile a list of questions and find the answers. 

 
## Reflect
Navigate to your `my-reflections-week-2` file (Pro-tip: Use terminal) 

Answer: 

- What resources you used and why 
- Obsticals you came up against and how you over came them
- What questions did you ask, and how was the process of solving them? 
- Did you keep within the timebox suggestions? If not, how come?
- What are of you proud of 
- What would you do better if you did it all over again?
