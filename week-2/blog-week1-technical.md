# U1.W2: Technical Blog

### Learning Competencies
- Compare CSS concepts to determine the differences
- Explain how and when to use CSS concepts


## Summary:
Writing blogs on technical subjects is something that will help you solidify your learning.

## Release 0: Copy your blog template
Create a new HTML file and use the date to name it `week1_technical.html`. Copy the code from your `html-template.html`.

## Release 1: Select a Topic
Research one of the following topics:

- What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?
- What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?
- What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning? 
- What does it mean to display inline vs inline blocks?

## Release 2: Blog!
Write a blog post that teaches others how and when to use each thing. There is no length requirement, but it should show off the knowledge you gained this week. You should show examples of code and screen shots to help teach others!

**HINT:** Intend your blog for a non-technical audience. Imagine explaining to a non-technical friend, for instance. Try to take a person step-by-step through understanding one of the topics above.


## Release 3: Publish
Link to your post from `index.html` so people can navigate to your page from your site's index. 

Make sure the index of your site is maintained, nice, and professional. This is your face in the online community, so make it nice!

## Release 4: Share!

Share your blog on your cohort's slack channel. Read others and see if you agree or disagree. Start a discussion on this topic.  





# Technical Blog - T1 

### Learning Competencies 
By the end of the first part, you should:

- Selected a path to learn from and gain an understanding in: 
  - Basic HTML page with and tags (html, head, title,etc.)
  - Adding paragraphs, headings, links, images, lists, tables  
  - Diving content on a page using divs and spans

- Understand and apply classes, id's  
- Navigate the DOM

## Summary
We've selected a couple of choices for learning HTML and CSS. You'll need to create an account with FreeCodeCamp and  Udacity and give each a go. 

Udacity is media rich, with some files to practice. 
FreeCodeCamp is practice rich and requires you to apply a little more problem solving. 

Try them both, get a sense for which resource suits your learning style better, and stick with that, completing the recommended courses.  

Always keep in mind the learning objectives. Ask yourself for example, "Can I navigate the DOM?". The courses should cover all the basics, but if you're still wondering "what is the DOM" then put your problem solving powers to good use and discover it. Frame the question well, reach out and have a discussion with someone in your cohort. Bring it up during a check in. 


## Exploration and Application

Exploration | Time to box |
------------|----------|
Quick primer | 4 minutes 
Udacity or Freecode camp | 10 hours

Reflection | 1 hour


## Quick Primer 
[4 minute summary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT0Lh1eYk78) of what HTML, CSS and JavaScript are. 


__Pro-tip-1: You can adjust the speed of the video's in YouTube and Udacity to suit your learning pace__  
__Pro-tip-2: Stay focused, don't get lost in the details__  

## Preparing for surprises
Just like everything on the web, FreeCodeCamp and Udacity have their bugs. In some cases, your solution might be perfect, but FreeCodeCamp is throwing an error. It can take some patience to discern if the error is a bug or if its caused by your code. One of your tasks as budding web developer, is to query errors and recognise where the error is comming from.

Ask yourself - does it work in a different browser? Have other's encoutered this error? 

## FreeCodeCamp + YouTube

FreeCodeCamp's interface can appear a little unfriendly to the untrained eye, but its methodology is solid. You'll be using the "Responsive web Design track". Pair it with demonstrations from YouTube to enhance your learning. 

__Instructions__
1. Sign up to freeCodeCamp using your GitHub login. 
2. As you complete each of the courses below search for YouTube content to supplement your learning. See example below
3. [Complete Introduciton to Basic HTML and HTML5](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5)  
4. [Complete Introduction to Basic CSS](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/basic-css)  
5. [Complete Introduction to Responsive Web Design Challenges](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-principles/)

## Udacity 

Udacity is media rich, and has practice files to follow along. Its a fairly popular way to learn. You'll need to sign up for an account using your email address.

## Online research 
Start identifying what it is that you need to know in order to reach the learning Competencies. Where are your knowledge gaps? Compile a list of questions and find the answers. 

 
## Reflect
Navigate to your `my-reflections-week-2` file (Pro-tip: Use terminal). Remember to stage, commit and push! 

Answer: 

- What resources you used and why 
- Obsticals you came up against and how you over came them
- What questions did you ask, and how was the process of solving them? 
- Did you keep within the timebox suggestions? If not, how come?
- What are of you proud of 
- What would you do better if you did it all over again?
