#My Reflections - Sprint Two



In addition to the challenge specific refletions, answer the following questions in your reflection:



* What parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face?
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?
* Which parts of the work did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the work did you find tedious?

Describe what you did in this exercise. Did you understand the steps that you were making? Can you describe them in simple lay terms?

-building your blog using HTML and CSS while honing my GitHub
mijucho.github.io/(touch)inde.html
mijucho.github.io/(mkdir)blog/(touch)sprint1-techincal.html
mijucho.github.io/(mkdir)styles/(touch)main.css

Navigate to and open my index.html file and link to a CSS file by copy and paste
<link href=“styles/main.css” rel=“stylesheet” type=“text/css” />

Did you achieve the learning competencies and keep within the timebox? so far so good.
