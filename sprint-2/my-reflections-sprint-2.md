# My Reflections - Sprint Two 
**_Describe what you did in this exercise. Did you understand the steps that you were making? Can you describe them in simple lay terms?_**

In this exercise, I created an HTML file and a CSS file, and linked the two together. An HTML file is filled with the content of the webpage (e.g. text, images), and the CSS file––once linked to the HTML file––dicates styling and _how_ the content will be displayed (e.g. font, colour).

**_Did you achieve the learning competencies and keep within the timebox?_**

I kept within the time box initially, and completed the task within the timeframe. BUT then I remembered that I hadn't completed the additional sprint 1 reflection questions so I backtracked to complete them. After writing up my answers in Visual Studio Code, I hit a wall and couldn't figure out how to get my updates onto GitHub. I did git push, git merge, git add and commit, and I couldn't figure it out! I'm still working on it. Meep. I am sure that it has something to do with the branch and I hope to figure it out soon so that I can continue with Tech step 2.

## In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions in your reflection:


- How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?



- Which parts of this sprint made you feel capable?



- Which parts of this sprint made you anxious?



- How's your self critical voice going? What kinds of things did it say to you this time? How much did they affect you?



- If you were at a bar and somebody asked you, "How do you make a website?" what would you say?
