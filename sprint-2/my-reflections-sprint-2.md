# My Reflections - Sprint Two 
##HTML and CSS Blog Templates##

**_Describe what you did in this exercise. Did you understand the steps that you were making? Can you describe them in simple lay terms?_**

In this exercise, I created an HTML file and a CSS file, and linked the two together. An HTML file is filled with the content of the webpage (e.g. text, images), and the CSS file––once linked to the HTML file––dicates styling and _how_ the content will be displayed (e.g. font, colour).

**_Did you achieve the learning competencies and keep within the timebox?_**

I kept within the time box initially, and completed the task within the timeframe. BUT then I remembered that I hadn't completed the additional sprint 1 reflection questions so I backtracked to complete them. After writing up my answers in Visual Studio Code, I hit a wall and couldn't figure out how to get my updates onto GitHub. I did git push, git merge, git add and commit, and I couldn't figure it out! I'm still working on it. Meep. I am sure that it has something to do with the branch situation and I hope to figure it out soon so that I can continue with Tech step 2.

##Learn HTML and CSS Basics##

**_What resources did you use and why?_**

Udacity! I like the media-rich vibes––I find it easier to follow along with that sort of instruction rather than reading what I have to do. I learn best through examples.

**_What obstacles did you come up against and how did you overcome them?_**

Just a lack of understanding of the concepts. A total lack. Some of them I managed to play around with and figure out, and others I failed to even BEGIN to comprehend. When something just became too much of a struggle, I either viewed the answer or made note of it so as to ask an EDA facilitator later. I will admit that the final part of the course, I raced through because I was already unable to remember what I'd done in the beginning, so I didn't see the point of trying to understand even more new concepts. 

**_What are you proud of?_**

I guess that I'm proud of myself for completing the course in full, but there is definitely a critic knocking around in my head and screaming that I didn't do well enough, that I should understand more now, at the end of the Udacity course, than I do. Sad sad sad sad sad.

**_Did you keep within the timebox suggestions?_**

NOOOOOOOOOO. I went wayyyyyy overrrrrr and I still feel like I didn't retain ANY of the knowledge that I was meant to have. My brain feels fried but empty, and I know that I'll still have to Google literally EVERYTHING in order to create my blog. 

**_How much faster could you do it if you started from the beginning again, right now?_**

To be quite honest, I don't think that I'd be any faster! The more I try to understand a confusing concept, the more my brain throws up a block and REFUSES to even TRY coming up with another way to see it. So it becomes a spiral of non-understanding, which is why I think it'll take me just about the same amount of time as the first go around (I guess this means that I didn't understand the learning competencies, huh? Sigh).

## In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions in your reflection:


- How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?



- Which parts of this sprint made you feel capable?



- Which parts of this sprint made you anxious?



- How's your self critical voice going? What kinds of things did it say to you this time? How much did they affect you?



- If you were at a bar and somebody asked you, "How do you make a website?" what would you say?
