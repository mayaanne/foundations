#My Reflections - Sprint Two



*	Write a story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS.

When we build a  house,  the building needs the  structure and then it needs an interior and exterior decorations.
An HTML contains the structure of the page itself. It is kind of like the structure of the building. A CSS  contains the styling of the page. It allows you to change colors, positioning and more. It is kind of like the design of the building itself.

*	What obstacles you came up against and how you over came them?
I tried to use an image as a background of the web page and I used a CSS background-img and use URL and put my image folder name but it seems to not be working. I searched through the google and I found out that I need to add a parents folder. It sounds easy but I took a while to sort it out. Anyway happy to see my background images on the webpage.

*	Any moments of surprise or joy?
 When my logo and nav were located in the middle of web page nicely, I was so happy.
I still need to work out my article's title though. Because it wasn't quite centered..
