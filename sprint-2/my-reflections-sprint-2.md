# My Reflections - Sprint Two 
## HTML and CSS Blog Templates

**_Describe what you did in this exercise. Did you understand the steps that you were making? Can you describe them in simple lay terms?_**

In this exercise, I created an HTML file and a CSS file, and linked the two together. An HTML file is filled with the content of the webpage (e.g. text, images), and the CSS file––once linked to the HTML file––dicates styling and _how_ the content will be displayed (e.g. font, colour).

**_Did you achieve the learning competencies and keep within the timebox?_**

I kept within the time box initially, and completed the task within the timeframe. BUT then I remembered that I hadn't completed the additional sprint 1 reflection questions so I backtracked to complete them. After writing up my answers in Visual Studio Code, I hit a wall and couldn't figure out how to get my updates onto GitHub. I did git push, git merge, git add and commit, and I couldn't figure it out! I'm still working on it. Meep. I am sure that it has something to do with the branch situation and I hope to figure it out soon so that I can continue with Tech step 2.

## Learn HTML and CSS Basics

**_What resources did you use and why?_**

Udacity! I like the media-rich vibes––I find it easier to follow along with that sort of instruction rather than reading what I have to do. I learn best through examples.

**_What obstacles did you come up against and how did you overcome them?_**

Just a lack of understanding of the concepts. A total lack. Some of them I managed to play around with and figure out, and others I failed to even BEGIN to comprehend. When something just became too much of a struggle, I either viewed the answer or made note of it so as to ask an EDA facilitator later. I will admit that the final part of the course, I raced through because I was already unable to remember what I'd done in the beginning, so I didn't see the point of trying to understand even more new concepts. 

**_What are you proud of?_**

I guess that I'm proud of myself for completing the course in full, but there is definitely a critic knocking around in my head and screaming that I didn't do well enough, that I should understand more now, at the end of the Udacity course, than I do. Sad sad sad sad sad.

**_Did you keep within the timebox suggestions?_**

NOOOOOOOOOO. I went wayyyyyy overrrrrr and I still feel like I didn't retain ANY of the knowledge that I was meant to have. My brain feels fried but empty, and I know that I'll still have to Google literally EVERYTHING in order to create my blog. 

**_How much faster could you do it if you started from the beginning again, right now?_**

To be quite honest, I don't think that I'd be any faster! The more I try to understand a confusing concept, the more my brain throws up a block and REFUSES to even TRY coming up with another way to see it. So it becomes a spiral of non-understanding, which is why I think it'll take me just about the same amount of time as the first go around (I guess this means that I didn't understand the learning competencies, huh? Sigh).

## Add HTML and CSS to your Blog Challenge

### Part One:

**_Write a story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS._**

HTML is the content. It consists of the images and text that will be displayed on the screen. CSS is the styling, and depicts HOW the content will be displayed. Much like the Amazonian warriors not needing men, HTML doesn't actually need CSS in order to function. It will still be visible without CSS, but it won't look as pretty. CSS, on the other hand, requires HTML in order to be given life. (Apologies for the lacklustre storytelling––all of my creativity has been used up in styling my website. AHHHHHH MY WEBSITE!!)

### Part Two:

**_What obstacles did you come up against and how did you overcome them?_**

At the beginning of this exercise, I was completely lost and had NO IDEA how to proceed. I had a look at the blogs that my cohort have already put on Slack and they all looked so good––I had to no clue how to get from here to there! I feel like everything that I learnt on Udacity went in one ear and out the other, and my brain didn't retain anything. So I went back and watched the workshop video that Joseph made, and what do you know, he was right! It was all I needed to watch in order to learn HTML and CSS. Phew! Joseph, you lifesaver you.

**_Did you have any moments of surprise or joy_**

Yes I absolutely did! It didn't take me anywhere as long to beautify my blog as I had expected it to, and I was so proud of myself upon completing it! I'm sure that it is very different to what everyone else has done, but that's the glory of it, no? We all have the freedom to create whatever we can, whatever appeals to us. 

**_If HTML and CSS were animals, which animals do you think they would be? Why?_**

CSS would be a peacock, because it's colourful and it's pretty. HTML would be pea*hen*, because though it is plain, it is functional and nothing would be achieved (procreation) without it. 

## In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions in your reflection:

**_How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?_**

Eeeeeeeee ish? I feel like the CSS for my website is a messy bedroom, one that I don't know how to clean. It's as though if I try to clear one thing from the pile, I could upend the whole room. When you take a step back and look at the course as a whole, I feel like everything is foggy. There are bits and pieces of clarity but no real discerning objets that tell me where I am.

**_Which parts of this sprint made you feel capable?_**

Ahhhhhhh I think I only really felt capable after having finished the entire sprint, but I can't say that there was anything in particular where I felt like i was exceling. If I had to pick one thing that I understood, then it would be border boxes and colouring them. At least that's something! 

**_Which parts of this sprint made you anxious?_**

The second half of the Udacity course. It was all getting to be too much information and I started to feel overwhelmed and as though my brain couldn't take on any more information. 

**_How's your self critical voice going? What kinds of things did it say to you this time? How much did they affect you?_**

Ohhhhh she's not so good...I am endeavouring to practice self-compassion but it is not so easy as I had hoped. My brain is very much wired in a self-critical way of thinking. It said such things as 'You have no idea what you're doing, do you?' and 'Tell me how you did that. Go on, tell me!' (a query that would be met with crickets and silence). I felt very proud of myself once I'd finished the sprint, but I still felt verry foggy and fried. I was also pretty frustrated about not being able to figure out how to link the CSS sheet to my blog posts once I changed the link to blog/my-learning-plan.html, and having to revert the link to my-learning-plan.html ONLY so that the CSS would show. Sigh.

**_If you were at a bar and somebody asked you, "How do you make a website?" what would you say?_**

SCREEEEEEEEEEECH. That's what I'd say. Or I'd smile and talk about HTML and CSS, how the former dictates the content and the latter dictates how it is displayed. Then I would explain how linking the two together creates the aesthetic. Then I would smile agian and turn away, and internally SCREEEEEEEEEEEEECH.
