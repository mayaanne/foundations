# Sprint Two

In the first part this Sprint you'll dive into HTML and CSS, the language of the web, and use it to create a blog that you'll contribute to through out your journey. Secondly you'll use last sprints core material and reflections to pull together your learning plan. You'll need to arrange a time to pair with an EDA facilitator to establish to negotiate that plan.
