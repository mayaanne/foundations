# My Reflections - Sprint One 

## Version Control Reflections
 _What's the difference between git and GitHub?_
   Git is a version control software, a local platform from which you can edit a piece of work multiple times and have the ability to view the history and the version of each different edit. Hence, Version Control.GitHub is a web platform that uses Git and allows users to work collaboratively and simultaneously on the same project without altering or damaging one another's work.

 _Can you think of an analogy to describe them?_
   It is an individual vs a group scenario. Think team sports: a netballer trains at home everyday for an hour to become the best player she can be (Git). When the time comes to play ball, her team comes together, after having performed their own individual training tasks at home as well (Git + GitHub), and together, they function cohesively without ever tripping one another up (GitHub). 
   
 _Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?_
   Probably not. Does anyone remember anything if they don't revisit the material? Maybe only in the case of fight and flight, but that certainly isn't happening today.

 _Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?_
   I was better this time around than during the previous task (Command Line Primer). I only ran about 30 minutes over (I really struggled with the analogy question above), and that's because I checked in with Toggl every so often to see how I was running for time.


## Exploring Git Reflections
 _What is a GitHub work flow?_
   A GitHub work flow is the process through which a project is created and completed--from start to finish, and with all of the edits in between. Created using Git software, it is then stored and made accessible to edit and view on GitHub. (â€¦right????)

 _What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?_
	I was blocked MANY, MANY TIMES. When I got stumped, taking a break before returning to the task usually helped to clear my head. I tried not to simply guess any of the answers to the quiz questions because I wanted to know how the solution was reached--otherwise, I wouldn't know for next time! It's been a long time since I have studied anything and I know that we are only two days in but so far, I have been surprised by my own diligence. Having said that, I've also been feeling mighty slow and almost stunted in comparison to the rest of my cohort, who seem to have breezed through this step MILES ago. 

 _Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?_
   Use Google more to help me out. I often ended up stuck along the way because my computer responded differently to the way the lesson plan predicted. Instead of simultaneously looking to Google for help, I only reached out to the EDA peeps and ended up wasting mucho time in waiting for them to reply.


## Track and Commit Reflections
 _How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech savvy friends?_
   A simpler way to think of the term __commit__ is to replace it with the word _save_. As you go through your project, you are able to _save_ each edit that you make. This means that you are able to access every single different version that you have created along the way. You can also revert the project back to a previous edit if you decide that it is better than the current one. In coding, this is imperative because it allows you to return to a previous _saved_ version of the code, should, for example, a bug arise in the updated version that needs to be found and fixed. 

   Let's say I was writing a piece of prose. By __committing__ (_saving_) each version as I go, I am able to access all of the previous versions of my piece without having to search through various files or lose the content altogether (because of the backspace button, my old friend). I can also go back to an older version and start fresh if I decide that it is more lyrical and prose-like than the current one. 

   __Staging__ is the step that comes before __committing__ (_saving_) the updated file. It allows you to test the update before __committing__ (_saving_) it.


## Branch, Pull, Merge Reflections
 _What is master?_
   Master is the main source of code--the final product, if you will--with which users interact.

 _Why create a branch?_
   Creating a branch allows you to 'branch off' from the master copy of work so that you can change and update features without affecting the master itself. Only once the branch has been pulled and merged will it make changes to the master.

 _Do the concepts feel intuitive or difficult to understand?_
   I don't think that 'intuitive' is the word I'd use. I guess that _Master_ and _Branch_ make sense well enough, but add all of the commands into the mix and I would say DIFFICULT, definitely difficult.


## GitHub Fork & Clone Reflections
 _What are some examples of when you would fork?_
   Specific examples? Unsure, as yet. I imagine that any instance in which I see an improvement that can me made in a master branch is a time when I would fork the repository, make the changes in my own branch and then create a pull request for my improvements (if they are, in fact, improvements) that can then be merged with the master branch (with the maintainer's approval).

 _Write your own step-by-step fork and clone instructions. Describe what you did._
 1. On GitHub, fork the repository from the origin user to your own account.
   2. From your fork, go into settings-->options-->issues and make sure the issues box is selected. 
 3. Click the clone button and copy the URL.
 4. Switch over to your terminal. Ensure that you are in the correct folder (in which you want the forked repository to be saved) before continuing. Once you are in your preferred folder, enter the __git clone__ command and paste the URL. Hit enter.
 5. Once it has finished loading, navigate into the cloned repository. You will know that you are in it because it will say __(master)__ beside your username.

 _Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked?_
   I definitely understood __forking__ more than __branching__. In the previous __Branch, Pull Merge__ challenge, I actually __forked__ the file rather than __branching__ it. I don't know how I'd have __branched__ it. Do I not know how to __branch__?? Ughhhhh. Brain. 

   Anyway, whilst it looks as though __branching__ may have fallen flat, __forking__ seemed to click. There's got to be a _that's what she said_ joke in there somewhere...


In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions in your reflection:


- What parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face?



- How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?



- Which parts of the work did you enjoy?



- Which parts of the work did you find tedious?



- Did you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this sprint? What did it say to you? Do you believe what it said?
