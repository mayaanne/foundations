# Opening VS Code in the Terminal

Once you've gone through this setup, you'll be able to type `code .` to open the whole folder you've navigated to in the terminal, in VS Code. Or `code my-file-name.md` to open a specific file. It is quite useful to be able to open files that you are working on directly from the terminal, instead of having to open it through the GUI (graphical user interface).

When VS Code is installed on a Linux system, the `code` command is automatically added to the terminal. Mac OS and Windows have different setup methods. Follow the link below and under the heading that matches your machine and follow the __Tips__ sections. 

###Side Note for Mac OS users:

When asked to open the Command Palette in VS Code, press __Shift + Command + P__
