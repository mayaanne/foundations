## Steps

__Important!__ Make sure you do not clone the new repo (Ko Wai Koe) into an already existing repo. We recommend creating a 'Dev-Acadedmy' parent directory that can contain your Dev Academy Repos. 

Cloning to the same parent directory is fine, for example:  

Example: Good 
`User/Hemi/Dev-Academy/Ko-wai-koe`  
`User/Hemi/Dev-Academy/A-second-repo` 
`User/Hemi/Dev-Academy/A-third-repo` 

Example: Incorrect   
`User/Hemi/Dev-Academy/an-already-cloned-repo/a-second-repo`
  

1. Navigate to https://github.com/dev-academy-programme/ko-wai-koe   
2. Clone it (somewhere other than Foundations repo)   
3. Create a branch using your full-name e.g. hemi-marton  
4. Switch to that branch (checkout)  
5. Create a .md file and save it as your-full-name (e.g. Hemi-Marton.md) 
6. In your file write your mihimihi or copy and paste the template (below) with your answers  
7. Save your file and stage it 
8. Check for and pull down any changes on Master 
9. Push to a new branch on origin (hint `git push origin your-name`)  
10. Create new pull request (hint: Navigate repo on GitHub website and create pull request from there)  
11. Ask someone in your cohort to Merge your pull request and delete your branch
12. Checkout master and pull down changes
