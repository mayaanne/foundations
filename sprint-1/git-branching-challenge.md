## Repos within repos

__Important!__ Make sure you do not clone the new repo (Ko Wai Koe) into an already existing repo. We recommend creating a 'Dev-Academy' parent directory that can contain your Dev Academy Repos. If you put one repo inside another, it's very easy to get confused and you may end up committing the whole thing somewhere you did not intend.

Cloning to the same parent directory is fine, for example:  

Example: Good 
```sh
User/Hemi/Dev-Academy/Ko-wai-koe  
User/Hemi/Dev-Academy/A-second-repo 
User/Hemi/Dev-Academy/A-third-repo
```

Example: Incorrect   

```sh
User/Hemi/Dev-Academy/an-already-cloned-repo/a-second-repo
```
  
## Steps

1. Navigate to https://github.com/dev-academy-foundations/ko-wai-koe   
2. Clone it (somewhere other than `Foundations` repo).
3. Create a branch using your full-name e.g. `hemi-marton`.
4. Switch to (`checkout`) the new branch.
5. Create an `.md` file and save it as your-full-name (e.g. `Hemi-Marton.md`) .
6. In your file write your mihimihi or copy and paste the template (below) with your answers.
7. Save your file, stage and commit it.
8. Check for and pull down any changes to the `master` branch. The simplest way is to checkout `master`, pull, and then checkout your branch again.
9. Push to a new branch on origin (hint `git push origin your-name`).
10. Create a new pull request (hint: navigate to the repo on GitHub, choose your branch and click _New pull request_.
11. Ask someone in your cohort to `merge` your pull request and delete your branch.
12. Checkout master and pull down changes.
