Getting unblocked 

The internet is fully of bugs! 
Everything you do as a web developer is process of working towards a state of less broken. 

Sometimes the error will be your code, othertimes it will be in the tests, in the descriptions or challenges.
Harness your problem solving skills to understand firstly where the error is and secondly to overcome it. 

## Tips and Resources 

- __Punctuation and spelling:__  Have you left out a closing braket? A semi-colon?  
- __Different browser:__  Does it work in another browser?  
- __Repl.it:__ Does it work on Repl? Are you getting the expected results? 
- __Are others experiencing the problem? Google the exact phrase!__ 
    
    For example, I copied and pasted the exact description from a FreeCodeCamp challenge that I couldn't solve _"Add a media query, so that the p tag has a font-size of 10px when the device's height is less than or equal to 800px."_ 
    Immediately I found many others submiited this as an issue. Try it yourself. 

    As well as identifying if this is a common bug, this type of query on google will likely render the correct code also. Check your code and move on. 

- __StackOverflow:__ Over 50 million developers sharing knowledge. 
- __Slack HelpDesk channel:__ Reach out on the EDA Slack channel. Share what it is your trying to achieve, the inputs (your code) and the exact error message. 
- __YouTube FreeCodeCamp:__ FreeCodeCamp publish live coding / code demonstrations. [FreeCodeCamp channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ)
- __YouTube FreeCodeCamp Users:__ FreeCodeCamp contributors also create code demo's for challenges. Check out [We Will Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_rvr8EdhCg&list=PLF4Fpfzm6Ig3smsMQEqKRTAlgOdoee7AJ) for a demo each challenge if you get stuck.
- __Browser Console:__ Inspect the webpage using the browser console. What can you see?  
- __Comment Out__  Comment out portions of the code until all that is left is the portion with the problem. Once you have narrowed down the problem area, begin subtracting elements until the problem goes away. For example, if you've narrowed down the problem to a specific <div> and the CSS that styles it, begin by removing one line of CSS at a time.

## Encountering problems 
(Thanks Richard Reis for these tips - Read Richard's [blog](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2) for a fuller explination.

1. Understand   
Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them (hence why this is the first step).

How to know when you understand a problem? When you can explain it in plain English.

<blockquote>If you can’t explain something in simple terms, you don’t understand it.” — Richard Feynman</blockquote>

2. Plan
Don’t dive right into solving without a plan (and somehow hope you can muddle your way through). Plan your solution!

Nothing can help you if you can’t write down the exact steps.

To get a good plan, answer this question:

“Given input X, what are the steps necessary to return output Y?”

3. Divide
Pay attention. This is the most important step of all.

Do not try to solve one big problem. You will cry.

Instead, break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.


<blockqute>“If I could teach every beginning programmer one problem-solving skill, it would be the ‘reduce the problem technique.’
For example, suppose you’re a new programmer and you’re asked to write a program that reads ten numbers and figures out which number is the third highest. For a brand-new programmer, that can be a tough assignment, even though it only requires basic programming syntax.
If you’re stuck, you should reduce the problem to something simpler. Instead of the third-highest number, what about finding the highest overall? Still too tough? What about finding the largest of just three numbers? Or the larger of two?
Reduce the problem to the point where you know how to solve it and write the solution. Then expand the problem slightly and rewrite the solution to match, and keep going until you are back where you started.” — V. Anton Spraul

4. Stuck?
First off, take a deep breath.

- The difference is the best programmers/problem-solvers are more curious about bugs/errors than irritated.

In fact, here are three things to try when facing a whammy:

Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. Programmers call this debugging (in fact, this is all a debugger does).

Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?  

Research: Ahh, good ol’ Google. You read that right. No matter what problem you have, someone has probably solved it. Find that person/ solution. In fact, do this even if you solved the problem! (You can learn a lot from other people’s solutions)

Caveat: Don’t look for a solution to the big problem. Only look for solutions to sub-problems. Why? Because unless you struggle (even a little bit), you won’t learn anything. If you don’t learn anything, you wasted your time.

5. Practice  
Don’t expect to be great after just one week. If you want to be a good problem-solver, solve a lot of problems!

Practice. Practice. Practice. It’ll only be a matter of time before you recognize that “this problem could easily be solved with <insert concept here>.”
