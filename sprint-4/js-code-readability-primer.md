# Code Readability Primer

- won't be the only one working on your code
    - colleagues 
    - employees after you leave
    - open source means everyone
- want someone else to be able to pick up your code after you and not have to spend a week just trying to understand it

---

Readability means (to me):
- indentation/formatting to standards
- consistenty in how you name things and how you format
- name things well (funcs and vars) so you can tell what they do/are
- break things into small segments (many small funcs > one big func)
- functions do one thing 
- DRY (don't repeat yourself)
- commenting a complicated section so people have some idea before reading
- not commenting everything/obvious things

---

You will write things once through rough, and then come back to it.\
This is called refactoring. Includes tidying, writing more concise code, making the code easier to read.

Doesn't need to be pretty the first time, but make it pretty before you leave.
