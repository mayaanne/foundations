# Code Readability Primer

- won't be the only one working on your code
    - colleagues 
    - employees after you leave
    - open source means everyone
- want someone else to be able to pick up your code after you and not have to spend a week just trying to understand it

---

Readability means (to me):
- indentation/formatting to standards
- name things well (funcs and vars) so you can tell what they do/are
- break things into small segments (many small funcs > one big func)
- functions do one thing 
- DRY (don't repeat yourself)
- commenting a complicated section so people have some idea before reading
- not commenting everything/obvious things

---

You will write things once through rough, and then come back to it, refactor, tidy. Doesn't need to be pretty the first time, but make it pretty before you leave.
