### Learning Competencies 
By the end of this primer, you should be familiar with and able to :

- Explain what is code readability, why it's an important skill to have as a developer and what code readability habits you can start building on today.


## Summary
When writing or working on code as a developer, you will find you won't be the only one working on your code. You will need to share your code with colleagues or employees after you leave and you want someone else to be able to pick up your code after you and not have to spend a week just trying to understand it.  This is where Code Readability comes in.

## Code Readibility 
Code Readibility is about practising the following habits when you are working on code:
- Indentation/formatting your code to best practice standards.
- Consistency in how you name things and how you format your code.
- Naming things well (things like functions and variables) so you can tell what they do or are.
- Break things into small segments (many small functions compared to one big functions).
- D.R.Y (Don't Repeat Yourself).
- Commenting a complicated section so people have some idea before reading.
- Not commenting everything or obvious things.
- Clean code.

## Research 
Have a good look around the internet to understand what code readability is and methods developers use.
To begin, check out Scott Granneman's article on [Formatting & Indenting Your HTML](https://www.granneman.com/webdev/coding/formatting-and-indenting-your-html) This is a great article to see what is a good method of indenting HTML.  Keep in mind - this style of indenting is what should be used in all your code from this point on.

Keep notes as you'll describe code readability in your technical blog this sprint. 

## Reflect 
In your [my-reflections-sprint-4](my-reflections-sprint-4.md) answer the following questions: 

1. What did I notice about my learning style, strengths and limitations when researching? 
2. Did any blocks come up for you? How did you overcome them?  
3. What Code Readibility habit will you begin implementing today?
