## Summary

In this challenge you will be using some of the built-in methods for arrays and strings. A built-in method is another name for a function that is already written for you and available in the basic JavaScript library, you just need to know how to use it!

Each function waiting to be written focuses on a different array method. You will need to research the methods you will use for each of these functions so you can make the tests pass.

The MDN documentaion can be a great place to start, as it lists _all_ the built-in methods available for both [arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) and [strings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String), but you will want to find your own resources about these methods to help you complete your functions.

## Get Coding
>You will find the functions for this challenge are held within the functions.js file.

You will need to complete the code that goes inside of our empty functions to get the tests passing. You should use built-in array and string functions to do this.

> The tests will give you some feedback on what they expected to have received from your function, and what they actually received.

Below are descriptions of what each function should do.

---

#### mushItTogether
>For some reason, we are receiving a list of individual strings, our function should take this list and return a string where these have now been `joined` together.

#### whereAreYou    
This function will require you to `find` the door number that Scooby is hiding behind.

#### deBee
To get rid of the bees in this string you will need to `split` the string into individual words before `filtering` out all those annoying buzzing sounds!

#### capitalize
We need to `map` over every word in a given sentence and Capitalize The First Letter Of Every Word 

#### sumAll
>So we don't have to add up all our numbers every time we need to, we're going to write a function to do this instead. This will `reduce` our list to just the total of all these numbers.
