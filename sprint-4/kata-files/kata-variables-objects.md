# JavaScript Variables and Object Types

## Learning Competencies
- Define local variables in JavaScript
- Create objects of different types in JavaScript
- Create and add objects to an array in JavaScript
- Use pre-written tests to drive development

## Summary
Now that you have learned a bit about JavaScript, it's time to use that knowledge a bit more. In this challenge you will be creating a series of variables. The values of the variables will be different types of JavaScript objects.

## [Repl.it](https://repl.it/@devacademy)
Making sure you are logged into your account, navigate to the [JS Variables and Objects](https://repl.it/@devacademy/JS-Variables-and-Objects) challenge. Starting the challenge will then fork it to your own account.

## Test-Driven Development
> If you look at the bottom of your index.js file, you'll see a function `assert`. These are tests that will help drive your development. In the developer world, basing your code off of tests is called Test-Driven Development (TDD) and is popular with many developers. 

The tests will tell you what code to write next. Run your code and read the message explaining why the code couldn't run or why the test failed. The first step is to make the first test pass. Then make the second test pass, and so on.

## Code it!
When you encounter the errors, write the code to pass the tests. When it passes, repeat the process until there aren't any errors left.

Hint: If you get an error message that says something like ...

`ReferenceError: secretNumber is not defined`, try declaring a variable with that name (i.e., `secretNumber`).

All tests will log `true` in the console when they pass -- `false`, otherwise.
