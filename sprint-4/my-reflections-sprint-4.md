# My Reflections - Sprint Four 

## Code Readability

**_What code readability habit will you begin implementing today?_**

I am going to start indenting my code because I hadn't previously been doing that. I tested it out on one of my blog HTML pages and it feels more comprehensive already. I like that it makes it so much easier to differentiate between which is the parent and which is the child element. I've just got to remember the exceptions to the rule (of which I really wish there weren't any, but such is life), like headings, titles and lists.

**_Does code readability seem important to you, or unecessarily fussy? Justify your answer._**

MUY IMPORTANTE. OBVIOUSLY. Remember when I talked about my CSS code in a previous sprint, and how it felt like a messy bedroom that I didn't know how to clean? Let me tell you––I WISH I COULD CLEAN IT! I just don't know how. I am a tidy person and my bedroom is definitely not a messy one, so you can imagine how I'm feeling about having an illegible website. GAHHHHHHH.

## In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions in your reflection:

**_How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?_**



**_Which parts of the this sprint made you feel smart?_**



**_Which parts of this sprint made you un-smart?_**



**_Did you remember to take regular breaks away from your screen during this sprint? How often? Did you stretch your body?_**



**_If you went back and did the Javascripts Basics course again from last sprint, how challenging do you think you would find it now?_**



**_If you could send a time traveling text message back to yourself at the start of this sprint, what would it say? _**



**_What is Javascript?_**
