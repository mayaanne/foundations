# My Reflections - Sprint Four 

## Code Readability

**_What code readability habit will you begin implementing today?_**

I am going to start indenting my code because I hadn't previously been doing that. I tested it out on one of my blog HTML pages and it feels more comprehensive already. I like that it makes it so much easier to differentiate between which is the parent and which is the child element. I've just got to remember the exceptions to the rule (of which I really wish there weren't any, but such is life), like headings, titles and lists.

**_Does code readability seem important to you, or unecessarily fussy? Justify your answer._**

MUY IMPORTANTE. OBVIOUSLY. Remember when I talked about my CSS code in a previous sprint, and how it felt like a messy bedroom that I didn't know how to clean? Let me tell you––I WISH I COULD CLEAN IT! I just don't know how. I am a tidy person and my bedroom is definitely not a messy one, so you can imagine how I'm feeling about having an illegible website. GAHHHHHHH.

## Code Readability Challenge

**_As a developer, how important do you think indenting is?_**

Very! It makes things a lot easier to follow and clearly differentiates between the parent and child elements. 

**_Do you prefer tabs or spaces when indenting?_**

Eeeeeee good question? I use spaces on VS Code because that's what it was preset too. I'll let you know if I have a preference should there come a time that I switch to tabs instead. 

**_What is your workspace like in real life? Clean? Messy? Is your code a reflection of that? Is your downloads folder a reflection of that?_**

MESSY. Downloads folder is sorted by date, so that makes thing easier, but it's still full of files that don't need to be in there anymore. As previously discussed, the CSS for my website is a MESS and the HTML probably isn't that much better. Meep. 

## Testing

**_Do you think you would prefer using Unit Testing or Test Driven Development? Why?_**

I think that I'd prefer Unit Testing because it breaks the code down into smaller sections. As a beginner, I need to make everything smaller so that it doesn't feel quite so overwhelming. 

**_How could these techniques be used together to make code that is reliable?_**

I don't HOW to make it happen, but if you could run the two tests as one then you'd be able to test your code on both a large and a small scale simultaneously, which I'm sure would make checking code a lot faster.

**_Was your initial response to the idea of testing, "That sounds useful" or "That sounds like a hassle"? Why?_**

Probably a bit of a hassle, but definitely a necessary one. Without testing the code, it'll be harder to pinpoint where the problems are. 

## Repl.it

**_What was your first impression of the Repl.it website?_**

I like it! I think it's similar to the sites that we used last sprint when using Watch and Code to learn about Javascript. Makes it a little easier to practice. 

**_How did you find using it in practice? Confusing? Useful?_**

I think that it's pretty straightforward, though my opinion might change once I start using it some more. Hopefully it stays this beginner-friendly!!

**_When you say the name of the website in your head, how are you pronouncing it? "REPLIT"? "REP-ILL-IT"? "REPELL-IT"?_**

"REP-ILL-IT"!

## Problem Solving and Pseudocode

**_Pick two problem solving techniques you would like to put into practice. Which ones have you chosen?_**

Googling and asking peers for help. 

**_How will you implement these techniques into your day to day coding flow? How will you make sure that you actually do them?_**

Google is the new bible, let's be honest. It has the answers to just about everything and I should be utilising it more than I am. Also, I'm afraid to ask my peers for help because I'm afraid to look as completely incompetent as I feel (which is VERY, VERY incompetent). But, alas, the process of progression will be a lot slower if I stay in this stubborn mindset.

## Javascript Variables and Object Types

**_How did you find working through the Variables and Objects kata?_**

SO MUCH EASIER THAN I WAS EXPECTING. Honestly, when I first opened the page in Repl.it I was seriously questioning my decision to do coding. But then I figured it out and realised that I could actually figure it out, and I felt a BAJILLION TIMES BETTER. Like, maybe I can do this???!

**_Did you look at the tests while coding the kata? Whas it helpful?_**

I did run the tests after each step but rather than read the error message, I read the information given in the following step. In this instance, it was easier for me. In future, things might be different. 

## Manipulating Javascript Objects

**_What was the highlight of this kata for you?_**

Completing it without having to ask for help (except from Google, but that's a part of problem solving so I am 100% okay with it)!! I am so proud of myself for just working thorugh it and actually using my problem solving skills. YEEEEEEEEE!

**_Did you find you preferred following the steps given here or using the test outputs in your repl? Why?_**

Due to screen constraints and the difficulties of switching between multiple windows, it was easier for my to just use the steps on repl. However, having both sets of steps was a really good thing in the sense that it gave me two different sets of instructions to answer the same question. 

## FizzBuzz (Super Edition)

**_What was the most challenging part of Super FizzBuzz for you?_**

Sigh. I found the answer thinking that it was a hint––a how-to or a suggestion––but nope, it was the answer. And of course, once I'd run the code and realised it was the answer, I didn't know how to then go back and try to discover the solution for myself. I don't know the process that I'd have taken. The only thing that I figured out on my own was that it required an if/else statement to be solved. I guess that counts for something? Sigh. Maybe I can leave it for a couple days and come back to it later in the week to try again, this time WITHOUT looking at the solution. 

**_How did you find using pseudocode during this kata?_**

It was helpful to know what I wanted the code to do, but I'm not sure that my pseudocode counted as 'steps'. It was more that I rewrote and simplified the question. Double sigh. 

## A Gradebook from Names and Scores

**_What was a surprising moment for you in this Gradebook Kata?_**

Realising that actually, I can code! Who'd have thought. I surprised myself GREATLY whenever I got the correct answer. Perhaps I'm not quite so incompetent as I believe. 

## In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions in your reflection:

**_How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?_**



**_Which parts of the this sprint made you feel smart?_**



**_Which parts of this sprint made you un-smart?_**



**_Did you remember to take regular breaks away from your screen during this sprint? How often? Did you stretch your body?_**



**_If you went back and did the Javascripts Basics course again from last sprint, how challenging do you think you would find it now?_**



**_If you could send a time traveling text message back to yourself at the start of this sprint, what would it say?_**



**_What is Javascript?_**
