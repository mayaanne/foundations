# My Reflections - Sprint 4

What did I notice about my learning style, strengths and limitations when researching?
This time seems easy to learn about indentation/formatting code.
Scott Granneman's article explained stright foward about good method of indenting HTML.

Did any blocks come up for you? How did you overcome them? no.

What code readability habit will you begin implementing today?
I knew about indent text/content, basic structure of a webpage. After reading the article made me clearer about writing clean code.


In addition to the challenge specific refletions, answer the following questions in your reflection:




* What parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?
* Which parts of the work did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the work did you find tedious?

As a developer, how important do you think indenting is?
The purpose of code indentation and style is to make the program more readable and understandable. It saves lots of time while we revisit the code and use it. a proper code indentation will make it easier to read, understand, modify, maintain and enhance.

Do you prefer tabs or spaces when indenting?
I prefer to use and tab and shift.
