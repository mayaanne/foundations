# Pseudocode and Problem Solving

- as a devaloper, your life is full of problems
- learn how to break down problems 
- small parts fix large problems
- look at what info you have and where you want to get to
- think of some ways you might get there before you start coding

#### Problem solving techniques:
- Pseudocode
- Trying something
- Rubber ducky method
- Reading error messages
- Console.logging
- Googling
- Asking your peers for help
- Asking coaches for help
- Improving your process with reflection

#### Pseudocode

- Is a way of breaking down a large function into the small steps that need to happen.
- You can make the small parts work, and this makes the whole thing work eventually
- Time taken now to think through steps now can save you a whole bunch of time later
- is like a recipe, you don't need to look at the fine details until you get to that step 
    - my brownie recipe: put butter, sugar, and cocoa in bowl and microwave. mix in vanilla and eggs. add flour until thick. bake. 
    - Don't need the specific deets until you get to that step
