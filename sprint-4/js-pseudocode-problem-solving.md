# Problem Solving and Pseudocode

### Learning Competencies 
By the end of this primer, you should be familiar with and able to explain:

- Why problem solving is an important skill to have as a developer.
- A variety of problem solving techniques you can start using today starting with pseudocode.

## Summary
As a developer, before you even start to code you need to make the time to think of ways you might approach a problem you are trying solve.   You'll need to learn to look at problems, look at the information you have and figure out how are you going to get to where you want to be. You will need to learn how to take a problem and break it down into smaller parts and begin fixing your way towards building a solution.
Throughout your journey in Web Development, you are going to be confronted with a range of problems.  It is important you are equipped with skills you will need to solve these problems.

## Problem Solving 


## Research 
Have a good look around the internet to understand what code readability is and methods developers use.
To begin, check out Scott Granneman's article on [Formatting & Indenting Your HTML](https://www.granneman.com/webdev/coding/formatting-and-indenting-your-html) This is a great article to see what is a good method of indenting HTML.  Keep in mind - this style of indenting is what should be used in all your code from this point on.

Keep notes as you'll describe code readability in your technical blog this sprint. 

## Reflect 
In your [my-reflections-sprint-4](my-reflections-sprint-4.md) answer the following questions: 

1. What did I notice about my learning style, strengths and limitations when researching? 
2. Did any blocks come up for you? How did you overcome them?  
3. What code readability habit will you begin implementing today?
