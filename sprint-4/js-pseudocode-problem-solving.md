# Problem Solving and Pseudocode

### Learning Competencies 
By the end of this primer, you should be familiar with and able to explain:

- Why problem solving is an important skill to have as a developer.
- A variety of problem solving techniques you can start using today starting with pseudocode.

## Summary
As a developer, before you even start to code you need to make the time to think of ways you might approach a problem you are trying solve.   You'll need to learn to look at problems, look at the information you have and figure out how are you going to get to where you want to be. You will need to learn how to take a problem and break it down into smaller parts and begin fixing your way towards building a solution.
Throughout your journey in Web Development, you are going to be confronted with a range of problems.  It is important you are equipped with skills you will need to solve these problems.


## Timebox 

Challenge | Time|
------------|----------|
Research | 30 minutes
Practice | 1.5
Reflect | 30 minutes

## Problem Solving 
Problem solving is a key skill you will utilise as a developer. Here are some problem solving techniques you can try today: 
- Pseudocode.
- Trying something.
- Rubber ducky method.
- Reading error messages.
- Console.logging.
- Googling.
- Asking your peers for help.
- Asking coaches for help.
- Improving your process with reflection.

## Research 
From the list of problem solving techniques, if there are any techniques you have never heard of before - take 30 minutes to research these.
Keep notes as you'll describe problem solving in your technical blog this sprint. 

## Practice
Next, pick three problem solving techniques you would like to put into practice.  How will you implement these techniques into your day to day flow?  Be as specific as you possibly can and start putting these into practice.

## Reflect 
In your [my-reflections-sprint-4](my-reflections-sprint-4.md) answer the following questions: 

__Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:__
1. Got blocked on a simple problem
2. Solved a problem in an elegant way.


In both cases:
- What was the problem?
- What problem solving techniques did you use?
- How did you feel throughout the process?
- What did you learn?
