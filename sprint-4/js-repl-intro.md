# Repl.it

- node can run js files on your computer
- takes a bit to set up so we can use this browser version instead
- the site `repl.it` can do a bunch of languages, including html/css/js, but we want it for node.js
- chosing node.js will let us write a .js file and if we click 'run' at the top of the page, will execute whatever's in this file

---
- sign up
- we can create a project
    - choose language
    - name it
- i can see others projects
- if i change something in theirs, it won't alter theirs but instead make a copy
    - https://repl.it/@devacademy/Hello
- if logged in this copy will be saved in my account
    - can try this out by opening a private window and going to project they have just created (will create a version under anon)
