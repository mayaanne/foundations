# Testing

## Summary

Testing is an important and also rather large concept, and one that is hugely important to all areas of coding, that we are going to touch on only breifly in this sprint.

## Description

Testing is how we know that code works. It's what says code is reliable, that it isn't going to break and is doing what we want it to do. We will often say that code that isn't tested, isn't yet complete.

During Foundations most of the testing you will be doing will be manual testing, running the code and seeing that it is doing what you think it should be doing, or using `console.log`.

Two aspects of coding that we will see use during bootcamp are Unit Testing and Test Driven Development.

#### Unit Testing

- can be written after code
- creates reliable code
- creates reliability in small parts of code so larger parts can be built from it
- doesn't necessarily care about the larger functionality
- arrange act assert

#### Test Driven Development

- test driven == test first
- tdd forgoes writing "nice" code and instead makes code that works/suits a need
- need to first work out what those needs are
- can come back after and refactor code
- big picture down (almost opposite of unit testing)

>- educe maintenece
>- changes don't break existing features
