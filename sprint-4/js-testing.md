# Testing

- large concept 
- in all languages
- code that isn't tested isn't complete
- is how we know that code works
- two you will see most tdd/unit testing
    - manual testing is what you will do most in foundations, do thing, check it works
    - console.log is also this

Unit testing:
- written after code
- creates reliable code
- creates reliability in small parts of code so larger parts can be built from it
- doesn't necessarily care about the larger functionality

TDD:
- test driven == test first
- tdd forgoes writing "nice" code and instead makes code that works/suits a need
- need to first work out what those needs are
- can come back after and refactor code
- big picture down (almost opposite of unit testing)

these can be used together to make code that _works reliably_
