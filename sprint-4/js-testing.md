# Testing

- large concept (two you will see most tdd/unit testing)

Unit testing:
- written after code
- creates reliable code
- creates reliability in small parts of code so larger parts can be built from it
- doesn't necessarily care about the larger functionality

TDD:
- test driven == test first
- tdd forgoes writing "nice" code and instead makes code that suits a need
- need to first work out what those needs are
- can come back after and refactor code

these can be used together
