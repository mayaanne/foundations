# JavaScript Variables and Object Types Practice

## Learning Competencies
- Define local variables in JavaScript
- Create objects of different types in JavaScript
- Create and add objects to an array in JavaScript
- Use pre-written tests to drive development

## Exploration and Application

Exploration | Time to box |
------------|----------|
TDD  | 30 minutes
Code it | 30 minutes
Reflect | 10 minutes


## Summary
Now that you have learned a bit about JavaScript, it's time to use that knowledge a bit more. In this challenge you will be creating a series of variables. The values of the variables will be different types of JavaScript objects. Since you've already been working with variables and objects, this challenge should be mostly review.

## Test-Driven Development
If you look at the bottom of your [my_solution.js](my_solution.js) file, you'll see a function `assert`. These are tests that will help drive your development. In the developer world, basing your code off of tests is called Test-Driven Development (TDD) and is popular with many developers. Read [The Newbie's Guide to Test-Driven Development](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/the-newbies-guide-to-test-driven-development--net-13835) to learn more about TDD if you're interested.

The tests will tell you what code to write next. Run the code and read the message explaining why the code couldn't run or why the test failed. The first step is to make the first test pass. Then make the second test pass, and so on.


## Code it!
When you encounter the errors, write the code to pass the tests. When it passes, repeat the process until there aren't any errors left.

Hint: If you get an error message that says something like ...

`ReferenceError: secretNumber is not defined`, try declaring a variable with that name (e.g., `secretNumber`).

All tests will log `true` in the console when they pass--`false`, otherwise.

## Commit and push
Once you have added your code, push your solutions to GitHub.
