# DevTools Tutorial

### Learning Competencies 
By the end of this tutorial, you should be familiar with and able to :

- Navigate and edit a website's HTML and CSS elements using the Chrome DevTools inspector  
- Use DevTools to manipulate elements in the DOM 
- Use DevTools console and other commands 
- Examine network and resources 


## Summary
All major browsers include developer tools, which enable developers to examine the code of a webpage or app, as well as run tests and evaluate metrics related to that code. Chrome Developer Tools (DevTools for short) is the industry standard. 
DevTools alows us to access the DOM and assists us with testing and debugging websites and applications. 

In this exercise you'll be downloading the source files and following the DevTools tutorial.

__Pro-tip:__ The same process that you use for Mizuxe can be used for any website or app. 

1. Use the files and complete the [Google Chrome Developers Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4q86IjJFag).   
2. Go to a website of your choice. Use DevTools to manipulate some elements. Take a before and after screenshot.  
3. Save your screenshot in this repo with the file name `js-devtools-before.jpg`and `js-devtools-after.jpg`  

## Reflect 
In your [my-reflections-week-3](my-reflections-week-3.md) answer the following questions: 

1. What did I notice about my learning style, strenghts and limitations when doing this crash course?  
2. Did any blocks come up for you? How did you overcome them?
