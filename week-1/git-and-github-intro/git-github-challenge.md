# Git and GitHub Challenge

### Learning Competencies
By the end of this exploration, you should be able to:

- Navigate repositories in GitHub
- Fork, clone a repository
- Push changes


## Summary
You will use this deep dive exploration to create your own forked version of this repo. You will then clone a copy to your machine. This clone is where you will be working on for the rest of your learning exploration and assessments. Changes that you make will not change the master EDA version.


## Exploration and Application

Exploration | Time to box |
------------|----------|
Deep Dive | 1-2 hours
Reflect | 15 minutes |

Follow the time box suggestions. If you get stuck, take a quick break and come back to it. Reach out to the community on slack. Let the learning competencies be your guide.

## Pre-Requisites:
To complete this deep dive, you must have completed all [install instrutions](https://github.com/dev-academy-programme/orientation/tree/master/installation)


## Step 1: Fork
Create your own version of this repo by forking it. 

Origin: dev-academy-programme/foundations   
Destination: git-hub-user-name/foundations

## Step 2: Enable issues
On your fork, find the settings button and enable issues

__Privacy__
Your repository will be private by default. That is intentional. But others in foundations will have access to see your code and will be able to give you feedback because you are all on the same team (and have issues enabled). Please do not change any other settings. 

## Step 3: Cloning 
You may have to manually enter your __gitHub password__ in terminal, so make sure you know it before beginning this step.  

Right now your repository exists on GitHub, but in order to add or edit files using your text editor, you need it to exist on your computer. In git terms, this is called cloning a repository locally.

1. Click the clone button (copies link)

**Pro-tip: Do the following tasks using command line:** 

2. The link you copied will automatically create a directory called 'foundations'. __Think about where you that directory to live.__  Is it for example `desktop/dev-academy/foundations` or does it make more sense to have it on your root directory e.g. `users/tane/foundations` ? This is your learning journey, so you decide what logic makes most sense. __Go ahead and create the directory.__  

3. In terminal navigate __INTO__ _the directory you created and or decided on_
4. enter the command 'git clone' and use keyboard shortcut 'cmd v' (mac) or 'ctrl v' (win) to paste 
5 Follow the username and password prompts if required.

## Step 4: Open in Visual Studio
Visual studio is the text editor app you installed previously. Open it and then open the foundations file you just cloned to view your new local repo.
