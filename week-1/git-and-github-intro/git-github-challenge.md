# Git and GitHub Challenge

### Learning Competencies
By the end of this exploration, you should be able to:

- Navigate repositories in GitHub
- Fork, clone a repository


## Summary
Web Developers use tools to track their progress and create backups. GitHub is a popular platform for this, especially in the open-source community.

Most if not all of your tech module work will be done using GitHub.

## Exploration and Application

Exploration | Time to box |
------------|----------|
Give it a try | 20 minutes
Find out what it is | 60 minutes |
Apply it | 2 hours |
Reflect | 15 minutes |

Follow the time box suggestions. If you get stuck, take a quick break and come back to it. Reach out to the community on slack. Let the learning competencies be your guide.


## Give it a try
Usually you would need to download and install Git on your computer. But we recommend giving giving [this tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) a go first. Stop at part 1.12 "Pulling remotely".

## Find out what it is
Explore what is Git? What is GitHub? What is GitHub user flow?

Here's some resources to get you going.

*[Git and Github Crash Course Video (24 min)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc)

## Apply your knowledge

## Reflect
Reflecting is essential for solidifying your learning. Remember, reflections are for you, but they will also be read by others, so make sure to write for an audience.They should be only a paragraph long.

__In your reflection answer the questions:__
1. What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?
2. Did you complete all of the activities in the learning competencies?
3. In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain english? Can you think of an analogy for it?
4. Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?
4. Any surprises e.g. Super useful resources


## Stretch Competencies
Come back to stretch competencies in your spare time. Don't focus on them now while you're getting started
