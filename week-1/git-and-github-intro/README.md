## Summary
Web Developers use tools to track their progress and create backups. GitHub is a popular platform for this, especially in the open-source community.

Most if not all of your tech module work will be done using GitHub.

## Exploration and Application

Exploration | Time to box |
------------|----------|
Give it a try | 20 minutes
Find out what it is | 30-60 minutes |
Reflect | 15 minutes |

Follow the time box suggestions. This is a primer only and there is a deep dive challenge next to start applying this knowledge. Let the learning competencies be your guide.


## Give it a try
Usually you would need to download and install Git on your computer. But we recommend giving giving [this tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) a go first. Stop at part 1.12 "Pulling remotely".

## Find out what it is
Explore what is Git? What is GitHub? What is GitHub user flow?

Here's some resources to get you going.
- [Git and GitHub article](git-github-article.md)  
- [Git and Github Crash Course Video (24 min)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc)

The next part is a deep dive into git and GitHub.Feel free to stop the video and resume it when engaging with the deep dive. Remember your learning is your own.

## Reflect
Remember, reflections are for you, but they will also be read by others, so make sure to write for an audience.They should be only a paragraph long.

__In your reflection answer the questions:__
1. Whats the difference between git and GitHub?
2. Can you think of an anology to describe them?
3. Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?
4. Any surprises e.g. Super useful resources


## Stretch Competencies
Come back to stretch competencies in your spare time. Don't focus on them now while you're getting started
