# Command Line Primer (aka Terminal, Shell, Prompt)  

### Learning Competencies
By the end of this exploration, you should be able to do the following in/using the command line:
- Identify your location
- Navigate between directories
- Create new and delete existing directories and files
- Open files


## Summary
Programmers do not always have pretty ways to interface or test their code. Most spend a good deal of time in their command line - "a tool where you can use text commands to perform specific tasks." When you use the command line, you don't slow yourself down opening a finder and double-clicking on folders. Instead, you get to navigate around your computer, open, create, delete, move, files, etc. all using commands. It's quick, efficient, and easy once you get the hang of it.

Knowing how to use your command line will be vital to your success as a programmer. Fortuntatlely for now you only need to know a few commands.  

## Exploration and Application

Exploration | Time to box |
------------|----------|
Give it a try | 20 minutes
Find out what it is | 20 minutes |
Reflect | 15 minutes |

Follow the time box suggestions. We know its exciting to learn, but trust us, be wise on how deep you go. Let the learning competencies be your guide. Ask yourself if you know them.


### Give it a try
Follow this [useful guide](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendix-a-cli/ex1.html) to try it out. Don't be put of by the "learn python" reference. Notice the differnce between windows, linux and mac.

### Find out what it is
Have a look for some learning resources: Videos, tutorials, google.
For example I found this [useful introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDINUSK7rXE) by googling "Quick intro to command line" - __I recommend watching it__. If you're not satisfied with the results, try other key words such as "Bash, Terminal, Basic and cheatsheet"

### Reflect
Reflecting is essential for solidifying your learning. It will help you learn how you learn, give opportunities for sharing resources, and will help to demonstrate your knowledge of the learning outcomes.

Reflections are for you, but they will also be read by others, so make sure to write for an audience.They should be only a paragraph long.

Keep note of where you keep your reflection as you'll be asked to use them in a later task. Try if you like using your new command line skills to create a directory and file for your reflection.

In your reflection answer the questions:
1. What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?
2. Did you complete all of the activities in the learning competencies?
3. In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain english? Can you think of an analogy for it?
4. Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?
4. Any surprises e.g. Super useful resources


### stretch competencies
Come back to stretch competencies in your spare time. Don't focus on them now while you're getting started

- Remove or copy a directory
- Stream a file
- Find and look inside files
- Get help
