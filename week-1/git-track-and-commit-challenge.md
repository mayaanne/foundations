# Track, stage, commit and push!

## Learning Competencies

- Define "commit"
- Demonstrate best practices for commit messages
- Describe the three states of a file in git (working, staged, commit)
- Stage and commit a file
- Push your file up to GitHub

## Summary

Git works by following all of the changes in the files inside a git tracked folder. The save point in git is called a commit. Think of a commit like a checkpoint in a video game. It is a point where you can go back to and look at the state of the files at that commit. Just like in a video game if make the wrong decision, you can go back to the checkpoint. A commit is your safety net if you accidentally introduce bugs in your code. You can revert to a working state while you debug your code. It is a great idea to commit often to create more frequent save points to fall back on.

Your git Commit history is visible to us and we use it to assess your participation and engagement. Throughout the course we'll be looking at the frequency and consistency. So engage daily and commit often. That means when ever you add something that works, remove something, or fix something, commit it.  

## Exploration and Application

Exploration | Time to box |
------------|----------|
Stage | 30 minutes
Reflect | 10 minutes

Be mindful of your time. Don't go deeper than you need to go.

## Good Commit Messages 
Because commits are 'save points', it is important to write good commit messages so you (and others) know what each commit includes.
Follow [GitHub's convention](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3580013/should-i-use-past-or-present-tense-in-git-commit-messages?utm_medium=organic&utm_source=google_rich_qa&utm_campaign=google_rich_qa) and use (imperative) for your commits. E.g "Make dog bark" (imperative) vs "Makes dog bark" or "Made the dog bark"


## Stage
In the last challenge, you forked our repo and then cloned it onto your machine. You then added your reflections to your `my-reflections-week-1.md` file. 

Stage your `my-reflections-week-1.md` file. 

__Hint:__ Be sure to be in an appropraiate directory!

## Push
Push your changes back up to GitHub.  

Right now your `my-reflections-week-1.md` file lives on your computer, staged and ready to go. When you push your changes up, you'll be pushing to __the master copy of your forked version__. Don't worry, you won't be changing anything on our master copy. You have your own master copy and we have our ours.

## Reflect
Open your my-reflections file and answer:

1. How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savy friend?
