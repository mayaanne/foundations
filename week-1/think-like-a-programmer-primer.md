- Understand the meaning of 'thinking like a developer'
- Understand flipped learning

## Summary
A lot of people think that web development is about writing code. But actually web development is about solving problems and learning to think in a specific kind of way.

Its a practice that involves understanding the problem, planning your approach and knowing how to get answers. Our role is to help you along that path and encourage you to seek what you need to solve the problem. As such, we give you a framework of reference including learning objectives, and mentorship to help you self solve. This type of learning can be uncomfortable at first, especially if you are use to step by step instructions. But this way, you will learn quicker than you ever thought possible. Welcome to the World of Web Development!
