# Writing solutions process
The most important thing to remember is that anytime you lean outside of your comfort zone to learn something new and difficult, the neuron's in your brain form new and stronger connections. _See [Growth mindset](growth-mindset.md)_ And when you make new and stronger neural connections - that's when you're getting smarter. 

As a student you need to be comfortable 
- Persevering with a tough problem  
- Using process strategies to solve a tough problem  
- Recognising when it's time to ask for help  

## Process 
1. Understand: Get clear on what is being asked.
2. Plan: Plan your approach
4. Divide: Break into small steps 
3. Make an attempt at solving it (write Inital Solution) 
5. Improve your solution (Refactor) 
6. Learn what you learned (Reflect)


## Thinking Like a Programmer 
_Credit: [Richard Reis](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2)_

Problem solving is a meta-skill. And thinking like a programmer requires you to problem solve. 
Unless you have a system, this is probably how you “solve” problems: 

Try a solution.  
If that doesn’t work, try another one.  
If that doesn’t work, repeat step 2 until you luck out.     

Sometimes you'll luck out, but __the best way involves a) having a framework and b) _practicing_ it.__

## Framework
“The biggest mistake I see new programmers make is focusing on learning syntax instead of learning how to solve problems.” _— V. Anton Spraul_

So, what should you do when you encounter a new challenge?

###Understand   
Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them (hence why this is the first step).

__How to know when you understand a problem? When you can explain it in plain English.__
__If you can’t explain something in simple terms, you don’t understand it.”__ _Richard Feynman_>_

Write down the problem in plain english, doodle a diagram, or tell someone or something about it. Some people use [Rubber Ducky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huOPVqztPdc)   


### Plan
Don’t dive right into solving without a plan (and somehow hope you can muddle your way through). Plan your solution!

__Nothing can help you if you can’t write down the exact steps.__

In programming, this means don’t start hacking straight away. Give your brain time to analyze the problem and process the information.

To get a good plan, answer this question:

“Given input X, what are the steps necessary to return output Y?”


### Divide
The most important step of all! Do not try to solve one big problem!

__Instead, break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.__

“If I could teach every beginning programmer one problem-solving skill, it would be the ‘reduce the problem technique.

For example, suppose you’re a new programmer and you’re asked to write a program that reads ten numbers and figures out which number is the third highest. For a brand-new programmer, that can be a tough assignment, even though it only requires basic programming syntax.

If you’re stuck, you should reduce the problem to something simpler. Instead of the third-highest number, what about finding the highest overall? Still too tough? What about finding the largest of just three numbers? Or the larger of two?
Reduce the problem to the point where you know how to solve it and write the solution. Then expand the problem slightly and rewrite the solution to match, and keep going until you are back where you started.” — V. Anton Spraul

Break the problem into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.

Then, solve each sub-problem one by one. Begin with the simplest. Simplest means you know the answer (or are closer to that answer). Then connect the dots, connecting all your sub-solutions will give you the solution to the original problem. Congratulations!

### Stuck?
First off, take a deep breath.

__The difference is the best programmers/problem-solvers are more curious about bugs/errors than irritated.__

In fact, here are three things to try when facing a whammy:

__Debug:__ Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. Programmers call this debugging (in fact, this is all a debugger does).

__Reassess:__ Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?  

__Research:__ Ahh, good ol’ Google. You read that right. No matter what problem you have, someone has probably solved it. Find that person/ solution. In fact, do this even if you solved the problem! (You can learn a lot from other people’s solutions)

__Caveat:__ Don’t look for a solution to the big problem. Only look for solutions to sub-problems. Why? Because unless you struggle (even a little bit), you won’t learn anything. If you don’t learn anything, you wasted your time.

### Practice  
Don’t expect to be great after just one sprint. If you want to be a good problem-solver, solve a lot of problems!

Practice. Practice. Practice. It’ll only be a matter of time before you recognize that “this problem could easily be solved with <insert concept here>.”


## Conclusion 
Problem-solving is an incredible skill to cultivate (the meta-skill). When writing your solutions, use the framework.
