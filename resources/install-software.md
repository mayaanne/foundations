# Install software

At EDA you'll be using three tools every day: a terminal, an editor and Git (which you'll install in week 1). You'll also need a web browser of course, and for consistency we suggest you use Google Chrome. We'll be installing the following:

1. iTerm2 (Mac) or Babun (Windows)  
2. VS code  

---

## OS X (Mac) 

### iTerm (terminal)

1. Navigate to [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/)  
2. Download and install it  

> Context: Mac's come with an inbuilt command line called 'terminal', however iTerm2 is our terminal of choice. 

### Visual Studio Code (VS code)

1. Navigate to [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Download and install the current stable release
3. Unzip, and drag the app into your applications folder

> Context: VS code is a text editor. Developers write code locally their computer via a text editor, before pushing it up onto the web via terminal and GitHub. Other popular text editors include Sublime and Atom.

## Windows instructions

> Context: The Windows development environment can be a little tricky to set up correctly, mostly because of the lack of a good terminal. One option is to dual-boot Linux, a way of installing a development setup without sacrificing your current operating system. There are some good guides available to set this up. However it's probably not something you want to try first if you're just starting out and not feeling very confident.

### Babun (terminal)

1. Go to [Babun](https://babun.GitHub.io)
2. Follow the download and install instructions

> Context: Babun is quite a similar way of working to the Mac and Linux terminals, and will allow you to follow most of Phase 0 without installing other software.

### Visual Studio Code (VS code)

1. Navigate to [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Download and install the current stable release
3. Unzip and intstall it in your programs directory

> Context: VS code is a text editor. Developers write code locally their computer via a text editor, before pushing it up onto the web via terminal and GitHub. Other popular text editors include Sublime and Atom.
