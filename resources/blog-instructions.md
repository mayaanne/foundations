# Blog Instructions 

### Summary 
Each Sprint you'll produce 2 blog posts - 1 cultural and 1 technical. 
These are published to your `http://username.github.io/' page, which is visible to your cohort and anyone else you share the link with. Your engagment with the blog questions and content each Sprint count towards your Foundations assessment.  

## Blog Setup 
In Sprint 1's ["Setup new Repo & Create Blog Challenge"](../sprint-1/git-new-repo-github-pages-blog.md) you created a new repo github.io and cloned it to your computer. Hopefully you cloned it to a sensible file directory for example:

Example: Good   
`User/Kiri/Dev-Academy/kiri.github.io` 
`User/Kiri/Dev-Academy/foundations`    
`User/Kiri/Dev-Academy/ko-wai-koe`  

Example: Incorrect   
`User/Kiri/Dev-Academy/foundations/kiri.github.io`
