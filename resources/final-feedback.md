# Feedback 

## Continuous Improvement

At Enspiral Dev Academy, we strive for continuous improvement and understand our need to evolve our practices, curriculum and content.  The Foundations curriculum you are experiencing has grown from the feedback of hundreds of students who have come before you.  

To ensure we continue to improve, we ask for your valuable feedback on this Sprint.  


- [Feedback Form](https://goo.gl/forms/xJnibQuE3NHWzGNS2)

As you're coming to the end of Foundations, we also ask for your feedback on Foundations as a whole.


- [Final Feedback Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeFPbd2YiORtgMz2Q-RaO1ttVXB035KL8rrni-_bgfK3ZRa1w/viewform?usp=send_form)


We ask you complete this form at the end of you Foundations so we are able to do more of what is valuable to you (as a student) and do less of what isn't.

From the Enspiral Dev Academy Team, Thank you!
