# Accountability Groups 

### Objectives 
1. Crystalise concepts with your group
2. Get to know each other
3. Make sure everyone is doing ok - if not, help out where possible


## Summary 
Accountability groups are designed to give you a core group of people in your cohort to lean on and learn from. You will have challenges to connect/meet with them during Foundations, and will continue in an accountability group through to graduation (although the members of the group may change in Bootcamp). You will be working a lot with everyone on group challenges in later units, so it's important to start building relationships early. 

## Engagement 
If there is a member of your group who is not engaging, please email your facilitator to let them know. We will follow up with the person or provide you with additional information. 
We don't have visibility on how these groups are going, so for us to support them we need you to let us know if it's not working.

## Give Feedback 
Review the solutions your accountability group sent to you. Practice reading their solutions. See if you understand what is going on. If you don't, try to determine what it is that's confusing, is it related to your knowledge of the code or the way the code is written? Do you have any suggestions for methods or ways to improve the code?

Remember to keep your feedback Actionable, Specific and Kind (A.S.K.).

Be sure to send your feedback for your accountability group members' solutions (either by making a solution-review git branch, or through the agreed communication lines).
