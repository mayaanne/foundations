## Summary
Tēnā koutou and Welcome to day 1 of your learning journey! This primer is to introduce you to the format of Foundations. 

For full details, please see the student handbook. 

## Time Box 

Activity | Time to box |
------------|----------|
Read primer | 20 minutes |

Each primer, challenge or activity begins with the recommended amount of time to spend. There will always be more to learn than time available, and so managing your time well is a key to success.  

For example, this primer should take you 15 minutes: 

Keep a track of your time by committing to calaendar scheduling and/or use tools like toggl, pomodoro or a timer on your device. This is excellent industry practice, a skill you'll want to develop if you want to work remotely in your career or on code projects. 

The prep-curriculum included a primer on supporting you to develop good time managment and productivity. If you haven't completed the activity we suggest you do.

## Sprints 
A sprint is a term from the Agile software development method, that typically means "a predetermined timeframe within which the team completes sets of tasks from the Backlog."

In foundations we use the term 'sprint' to define a block of work. There are 5 sprints of work. How long a sprint takes will depend on if you are full-time or part-time

Study | Length of Sprint | Hours per week | Length of Foundations |  
------------|----------|------------|--------|
full-time(1) (FT1) | 1 week  | 36-40 hours | 5 weeks | 
Part-time(2) (PT2)* | 2 weeks | 18-20 hours | 10 weeks |
Part-time(3) (PT3)* | 3 weeks | 12-13 hours | 15 weeks |

_*PT2 and PT3 indexes the length of time you selected to study during your enrollment._


## Full-time vs Part-time 
There are variances in full-time and part-time delivery,but regarless of your status, the same rule for coding applies: 

__Code Every Day!__

Research shows that the mind is slower to engage after a period of dormancy. For example, if you've taken 2 days out from coding, the time to reorientate will be longer, than if you had spent 15 minutes coding on each of those days. Reflect on what you know about the neuroplaticity of the brain - each time you practice, you are strengthening the neural pathways of your brain,and ineffect improving your skill.  


### Full-time (FT1):  
Overview: 
- Similar to full-time job 
- Need to catch up if you miss a day 
- Complete specific curriculum tasks with accountability group 
- Technical workshop beginning of each sprint 
- Core check-in (1:1) weekly during each sprint
 

Foundations is like a full-time job. It requires about 8 hours a day of your focus and effort. If you miss a day, you'll need to play catch-up. 

You'll be working an accountability group (that your facilitator will set you up with) to complete specific tasks throughout Foundations. 

You'll also hopefully meet your part-time cohort who will begin to integrate and sync in as Foundations progresses. We encourage Tuakana/Teina and Student-teaching-student attitude, as it strengthens everyones learning. Lean on each other and learn together.   

Each sprint begins with a technical workshop via video call and a 'Core check-in' (1:1) with your facilitaor during the week. Your facilitator will establish the details with you. 

### Part-time (PT2 and PT3)
Overview: 
- Could be flying solo or with other part-timers 
- Complete specific curriculum tasks with Facilitator (unless advised otherwise)
- Technical check-in combined with core check-in delivered in one session, (unless advised by facilitator)
- Integrate in with cohort 5 weeks prior to bootcamp
 
Depending on the number of folk studying part-time, you could be flying completely solo, or together with a few others. 

Each sprint begins with a tech workshop via a video call. If you're flying solo, this will include an additional 'Core check-in' (1:1). If there are others in the workshop, then your facilitator will arrange a time for a the two of you to check-in.   

5 weeks before Bootcamp, the rest of your cohort will join Foundations. Over the following weeks, you'll be encouraged to sync in and particpate with them. We encourage Tuakana/Teina and student-teaching-student attitude, as it benefits everyones learning. You'll also be invited to join an accountablity group when the fulltime cohort begins. 

Until then, if you are flying solo, you may need to complete specific tasks from the Core curriuculum with your facilitator. 

## Schedule 
Each sprint you'll be engaged with a facilitator for both Tech and Core activities:

Activity | FT1 | PT2 | PT3 |
------------|----------|------------|--------| 
Tech workshop | Begining of sprint | - | - |
Core 1:1 | During sprint | - |  - |
Combined Core+tech 1:1 | - | Begining of sprint | Begining of sprint |
Pairing | Accountability group | Facilitator (or PT2 if available) | Facilitator (or PT3 if available) |
Assignment submission | Sprint end : Sunday 10pm | Sprint end : Sunday 10pm | Sprint end : Sunday 10pm |

## Content delivery 
Course material is delivered via GitHub, the platform you are currently viewing to read this material. 

A facilitator will be with you to support your growth and skill development. 

__Course content delivered via GitHub and supported by facilitator__

## Engaging with the material
Each sprint will have a list of activities to complete. Some of these will be 'primers' - priming you with enough context to get you going. Others will be 'challenges' which requires you to complete a set of tasks and some will be a combination of both. 

Activities are in sequential order. 
Some sprints inlcude additional stretch material for those who who complete all the tasks ahead of time, or who want to go further.

__Complete all activities, in sequential order.__  
__Optional stretch material available in some sprints__

## Submitting work 
To signal the completion of a sprint, you will need to  fill out a feedback form. Your responses will influence design and content improvements as part of our continual improvement framework. Your respponses will also help us to support you in your development. We will likely use some of your feedback in your 1:1 sessions. 

__Submit weekly feedback form by 10pm Sunday to signal completion of work.__ 

## Extensions 
If you are unable to complete the work by the end of the sprint, you must submit an extension request. All form links are located on the home index page of this GitHub repo. 

__Extension requests are necessary even for PT__

## Assessments 
The curriculum is not designed to teach people how to pass tests. Instead we aim to teach people to build useful applications. Assessment are still important so that students and teachers can evaluate progress. But the assessment is designed to be harvested continuously and unobtrusively during the students learning experience.

Passing is not the same as working code - we take into consideration your engagement, your skill development in process and provide opportunities for you demonstrate your knowledge. Assessments are not about making the code work, although, working code is ideal!  

__Assessments are not about working code__

## Model of Education and Flipped learning. 
For a more thorough explaination, see the 'EDA way' primer in the [prep curriculum](https://github.com/dev-academy-programme/student-prep/blob/master/prep-curriculum/core-approach-to-learning.md)

__Skills over Knowledge__
The curriculum prioritises growing skills over knowledge.

__Unobtrusive assessment__
Assessment is designed to be harvested continuously and unobtrusively during the students learning experience.

__Flipped classrooms__
Self determination and agency over your own learning is a key to success. Using a flipped classroom approach, your facilitators become your peers, there to help you think critically, self-seek solutions and overcome obstacles.

__Just in time learning__
Instead of delivering a large amount of basic content upfront we propose teaching core skills as students need them to achieve a challenge. This differs from the ‘just in case’ philosophy of many educators where students learn a lot of things they will rarely or never use in practice.



Mac, Windows and Linux each come with an inbuilt command line tool, however during prep you installed an alternative (iTerm2 or Babun).

You can use either the inbuilt tool or the recommended tool during this exploration. The commands and inputs are interchangeable, with only a few occassional variations for Windows. So, if you're following online tutorials, just switch out "babun" when the tutorial says "powershell". 

Operating System | Inbuilt tool | Recommended tool |  
------------|----------|----------| 
Mac | terminal | iTerm2  
Windows | cmd and/or powershell | babun/gitbash  
Linux | gnome | gnome |

## Give it a try
Follow this [useful guide](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendix-a-cli/ex1.html) to try it out. Don't be put off by the "learn python" reference. Notice the difference between windows, Linux and mac.

## Explore a little more 
Have a look for some learning resources: Videos, tutorials, Google. Try key words like 'Terminal', 'Command Line Basic' and 'cheatsheet'. Have you achieved the learning competencies? 

## Reflect
Reflecting is essential for solidifying your learning. It will help you learn how you learn, give opportunities for sharing resources, and will help to demonstrate your knowledge of the learning outcomes.

Reflections are for you, but they will also be read by others, so make sure to write for an audience. They should be only a paragraph long.

Keep note of where you keep your reflection as you'll be asked to use them in a later task. Try if you like using your new command line skills to create a directory and file for your reflection.

__In your reflection answer the questions:__
1. In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain english? Can you think of an analogy for it? 
2. Did you stick to the time box guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?  
3. Name 5 commands you used, and what they do 
4. Did you learn anything unexpected?
