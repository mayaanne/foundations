# Course outline - Getting started 
Tēnā koutou and Welcome to day 1 of your learning journey! This primer is to introduce you to the format of Foundations. 

For full details, please see the student handbook. 

### Learning Competencies
By the end of this primer, you should have an understanding of: 
- Time Boxinng
- What is a sprint 
- Full-time vs part-time study
- Schedule 
- Delivery
- Engaging with the material
- Submitting work and Feedback
- Assessments
- Model of Education and Flipped learning 


## Time Box 

Activity | Time to box |
------------|----------|
Read primer | 20 minutes |

Each primer, challenge or activity begins with the recommended amount of time to spend completing the activity. There will always be more to learn than time available, so managing your time well is a key to success.  

For example, this primer should take you 20 minutes.

Keep a track of your time by committing to calaendar scheduling and/or use tools like toggl, pomodoro or a timer on your device. This is a skill you'll want to develop if ever you want to work remotely in your career or on code projects. 

The prep-curriculum included a primer on supporting you to develop good time managment and productivity. If you haven't completed the activity we suggest you do.

## Sprints 
A sprint is a term from the Agile software development method, that typically means "a predetermined timeframe within which the team completes sets of tasks from the Backlog."

In foundations we use the term 'sprint' to define a block of work. There are 5 sprints of work. How long a sprint takes will depend on if you are full-time or part-time. Whether you are FT1, PT2 or PT3 depends on the length of time you selected to study during your enrollment. 

Study | Length of Sprint | Hours per Sprint | Length of Foundations |  
------------|----------|------------|--------|
<<<<<<< HEAD
full-time(1) (FT1) | 1 Sprint  | 36-40 hours | 5 weeks | 
Part-time(2) (PT2)* | 2 weeks | 18-20 hours | 10 weeks |
Part-time(3) (PT3)* | 3 weeks | 12-13 hours | 15 weeks |

_*PT2 and PT3 indexes the length of time you selected to study during your enrollment._

## Full-time vs Part-time 
There are variances in full-time and part-time delivery, but regarless of your status, the same rule for coding applies: 

__Code Every Day!__

Research shows that learning is quicker if you engage everyday and avoid periods of dormancy. For example, if you've taken 2 days out from coding, the time to reorientate will be longer, than if you had spent 15 minutes coding on each of those days. Reflect on what you know about the neuroplaticity of the brain - each time you practice, you are strengthening the neural pathways of your brain, and in effect improving your skill levels.  

### Full-time (FT1):  
Foundations is like a full-time job. It requires about 8 hours a day of your focus and effort. If you miss a day, you'll need to play catch-up. 

You'll be working an accountability group (that your facilitator will set you up with) and in your accountability group you will be completing particular tasks together. 

You'll also meet your part-time cohort who will begin to integrate and sync in as Foundations progresses. We encourage Tuakana/Teina and Student-teaching-student attitude, as it strengthens everyone's learning. Lean on each other and learn together.   

Full time students will have a tech workshop at the beginning of the sprint and a Core 1:1 check-in during the sprint. 

### Part-time (PT2 and PT3)
Depending on the number of folk studying part-time, you could be flying completely solo, or together with a few others. 

PT2 and PT3 students will have a combined tech+core session with their facilitator, unless there are other PT2 and PT3 students, in which case the sessions will likely be split into two: A group workshhop followed, by a core 1:1 later in the week. Your facilitator will advise you if this is the case.  

5 weeks before Bootcamp, the rest of your cohort will join Foundations. During this time, you'll be encouraged to sync in and particpate with them. We encourage Tuakana/Teina and student-teaching-student attitude, as it benefits everyones learning. You'll also be invited to join an accountablity group when the fulltime cohort begins. 


## Schedule 
Each sprint includes a technical and core check-in with your faciltator, depending on your full or part time status.  


Activity | FT1 | PT2 | PT3 |
------------|----------|------------|--------| 
Tech workshop | Begining of sprint | - | - |
Core 1:1 | During sprint | - |  - |
Combined Core+tech 1:1 | - | Begining of sprint | Begining of sprint |
Pairing | Accountability group | Facilitator (or PT2 if available) | Facilitator (or PT3 if available) |
Assignment submission | Sprint end : Sunday 10pm | Sprint end : Sunday 10pm | Sprint end : Sunday 10pm |

## Content delivery 
Course material is delivered via GitHub, the platform you are currently viewing to read this material. 
Your facilitator will journey with you to support, with the function to support your growth and skill development. 

__Course content delivered via GitHub and supported by facilitator__

## Engaging with the material
Each sprint will have a list of activities to complete. Some of these will be 'primers' - introducing to the context to get you going. Others will be 'challenges' which require you to complete a set of tasks. And some activities will be a combination of both. Some sprints inlcude additional stretch material for those with the time who want to dive deeper. 

Activities are in sequential order. 

__Complete all activities, in sequential order.__  
__Optional stretch material available in some sprints__

## Submitting work and Feedback
To signal the completion of a sprint, you will need to fill out a feedback form. Your feedback influence design and content improvements, as have those from hundreds of students gone before. In addtion to feedback being part of our continual improvement framework, it help us to support you and your development and will at times inform your 1:1 sessions. 

__Submit weekly feedback form by 10pm Sunday to signal completion of work.__ 

## Extensions 
All students, regardless of FT or PT status are required to sumbit work at the end of the sprint by 10pm Sunday. If you are unable to complete the material by the end of the sprint, you must submit an extension request. All form links are located on the home index page of this GitHub repo. 

__Extension requests are necessary even for PT__

## Assessments 
The curriculum is not designed to teach people how to pass tests. Instead we aim to teach people to build useful applications. Assessment are still important so that students and teachers can evaluate progress. But the assessment is designed to be harvested continuously and unobtrusively during the students learning experience.

Passing is not the same as working code - we take into consideration your engagement, your skill development in process and provide opportunities for you demonstrate your knowledge. Assessments are not about making the code work, although, working code is ideal!  

__Assessments are not about working code__

## Model of Education and Flipped learning. 
For a more thorough explaination, see the 'EDA way' primer in the [prep curriculum](https://github.com/dev-academy-programme/student-prep/blob/master/prep-curriculum/core-approach-to-learning.md)

__Skills over Knowledge__  
The curriculum prioritises growing skills over knowledge.

__Unobtrusive assessment__  
Assessment is designed to be harvested continuously and unobtrusively during your learning experience.

__Flipped classrooms__  
Self determination and agency over your own learning is a key to success. Your facilitators become your peers, who are there to support you to develop your own agency and self determination. 

__Just in time learning__  
Instead of delivering a large amount of basic content upfront give you just enough to achieve a challenge. This differs from the ‘just in case’ philosophy of many educators where students learn a lot of things they will rarely or never use in practice.
