# Listening and Looping

### Instructions 
Pair up with someone in your cohort and spend 10 minutes running through this exercise  

### Summary 
Conscious Listening is one of the methods we use for training Emotional Intelligence. Through training in Emotional Intelligence you improve your ability to understand yourself and others and your skills at communicating. These skills have a significant impact on your succssess in life - at home, at school, at work. 

### Conscious listening - a.k.a Listening and Looping. 
This skill can be incredibly useful - both in terms of the information one can recieve when you're not trying to think ahead about a response and in terms of the other person feeling met and much more likely to feel heard. Think "ok I'm just going to receive what you're telling me, what you're saying, how you're appearing". 

__Introducing Conscious (Mindful) Listening:__  
The way we introduce and practice mindful listening is through a listening and looping excercise, which we practice throughout foundations and bootcamp. 

The format is like this 

- Object of attention is the other person  
- In Pairs:   
    - Person A describesâ€¦.. for 2 mins  
    - Person B Mindfully listens  
    - In silence (can nod and smile etc)  
    - Person B loops back for 2 mins  

### Listening and Looping exercise 

- Partner up with someone in your cohort or on the Foundations Slack Channel. 

_Hint:_ Connect with another student through Slack.  Don't let not being face to face hold you back, you can set up a video meeting with another or organise a time where both of you can meet in person on campus.  You can choose.


- Spend 2 minutes each, listening and looping   
- Reflect  

__The Prompt:__ 
_Choose one prompt to use:_
- Talk about a time in the last Sprint when you felt triggered - Something difficult that came up which was challenging in some way. 

- Talk about a time in the last Sprint when you showed growth mindset qualities.   - What was the situation?  What will you do less of/more of or differently next time?

- Talk about a time in the last Sprint when you showed fixed mindset qualities.   - What was the situation?  What will you do less of/more of or differently next time?

- Talk about a time in the last sprint when you learned something new about yourself.

- Talk about a time in the last sprint when you felt the rewards of practice.

- Talk about a time in the last sprint when you felt overwhelmed or panicked. What techniques and tools can you to keep your cool?


    1. Organise to pair with someone in your cohort or accountability group. If you end up doing pairing with more than one person then great - the more you practice, the better you get. 

    2. Set a timer for 2 minutes.   

    3. Person A: Using the prompt, talk until the timer ends.  

    4. Person B: Practice mindful listening. You're going to listen attentively, the same way that you pay attention to your breath, you're going to pay attention to your partner and just be awake to whats happening. Be awake to whats going on. 
    
    5. After 2 minutes is up, Person B is going to loop back what you heard. Person A can then add little bits in or agree. Keep looping until you agree on that what was said has been looped back.

    6. Using the reflection file, discuss: 
        - What was it like to be fully listened to? 
        - What was it like to fully listen?
